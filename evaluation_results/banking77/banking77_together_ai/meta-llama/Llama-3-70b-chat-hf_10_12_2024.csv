Here's why:

* The user mentions ""strange charges"" on their card, which implies unauthorized transactions.
* They express concern about their card being stolen, which is a common symptom of a compromised card.
* They ask about canceling their card, which is a typical response to a suspected card compromise.
* Finally, they inquire about getting refunded for the charges, which is a natural follow-up question in this scenario.
