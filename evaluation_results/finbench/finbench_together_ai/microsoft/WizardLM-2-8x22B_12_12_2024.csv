The individual's credit score of 455 is considered subprime, which indicates a history of poor credit management or an insufficient credit history.

HIGH RISK

The individual's credit score of 632 is below the average score, which typically ranges above 700. Credit scores below 650 are often considered subprime and indicate a higher risk of default. Additionally, while the yearly income is moderate, the lack of information regarding the loan length, number of signers, and debt-to-income ratio makes it difficult to assess the ability to repay the loan comfortably. The high school education, while not directly correlated with loan repayment, can sometimes be associated with lower income potential and fewer financial resources","ModelResponse(id='8f13004ceccc440b-EWR', created=1734061944, model='together_ai/microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, choices=[Choices(finish_reason='length', index=0, message=Message(content=""\nHIGH RISK\n\nThe individual's credit score of 632 is below the average score, which typically ranges above 700.
