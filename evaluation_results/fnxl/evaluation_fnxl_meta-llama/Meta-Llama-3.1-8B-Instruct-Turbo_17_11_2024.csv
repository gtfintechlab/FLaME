1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**
The sentence is: ""The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2020 is approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate.""

The numeral in the sentence is: $1.0 billion

The context of the numeral is: ordinary dividends paid to the parent company.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.**
Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is: ""us-gaap:DividendsDeclaredAndPaid""

However, since the sentence mentions ""ordinary dividends,"" we need to consider the type of dividend. In this case, it's not specified, but we can use the more general tag ""us-gaap:DividendsDeclaredAndPaid"" as it encompasses ordinary dividends.

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.**
The numeral $1.0 billion is associated with the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:DividendsDeclaredAndPaid"".

**Sentence:** As a result, PT-FI offered to pay one trillion rupiah to settle these historical surface water tax disputes and charged $69 million to production and delivery costs in December 2018.

**Numerals:** [69.0]
**Company:** Freeport-McMoRan Inc.
**Document Type:** 10-K

**Analysis:**

- The numeral 69.0 is associated with ""production and delivery costs"" in the sentence.
- Production and delivery costs are typically categorized as Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) or Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses.

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the type of expense or transaction being described.
3. Match the context with the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Input Analysis:**

- Sentence: (4) Amounts for the third quarter of 2019 included upfront collaboration and licensing expenses of $3.92 billion, or $2.40 per basic and diluted share related to the collaboration with Galapagos.
- Numerals: [3.92, 2.40]
- Company: GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.
- Document Type: 10-K

**Context Analysis:**

- The sentence mentions ""upfront collaboration and licensing expenses,"" which indicates that the numerals are related to expenses.
- The context is a quarterly financial report (third quarter of 2019), which suggests that the expenses are related to a specific period.

**XBRL Tag Association:**

- For the numeral 3.92 billion, the context is a large expense related to a collaboration and licensing agreement. This is likely a non-operating expense, so I will associate it with the XBRL tag for non-operating expenses.
- For the numeral 2.40, the context is a per-share expense related to the collaboration. This is likely a non-operating expense, so I will associate it with the XBRL tag for non-operating expenses.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**

- us-gaap:NonOperatingExpenses (for 3.92 billion)
- us-gaap:NonOperatingExpenses (for 2.40)

However, since the 2.40 is per-share, it is more likely to be associated with the tag for earnings per share.

The jury also awarded Juno damages in amounts of $585 million in an up-front payment and a 27.6% running royalty from October 2017 through the date of the jury’s verdict.,[585.0],"GILEAD SCIENCES, INC.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the type of expense or transaction being described.
3. Match the context with the relevant XBRL tag.

From the sentence: ""The jury also awarded Juno damages in amounts of $585 million in an up-front payment and a 27.6% running royalty from October 2017 through the date of the jury’s verdict.""

1. The numeral 585 million is associated with an ""up-front payment"" and a ""running royalty.""
2. The ""up-front payment"" and ""running royalty"" are both types of expenses related to a transaction with a third party (Juno), not a related party.
3. Based on the context, the XBRL tag for the ""up-front payment"" and ""running royalty"" would be ""us-gaap:CostOfRevenue"" or ""us-gaap:OperatingExpenses"" since they are not related party transactions.

However, since the royalty is a percentage, it should be associated with the ""us-gaap:CostOfRevenue"" tag as it is a cost of revenue.

4. The XBRL tag for the numeral 585 million is ""us-gaap:CostOfRevenue"".

As for the numeral 27.6%, it is a percentage and should be associated with the ""us-gaap:CostOfRevenue"" tag as well.

5. The XBRL tag for the numeral 27.6% is ""us-gaap:CostOfRevenue"".

The sentence is: ""Upon redemption of the SNVPS or liquidation of KREF, the holder of the SNVPS is entitled to payment of $0.01 per share, together with any accumulated but unpaid preferred distributions, including respective call or put amounts, before any holder of junior security interests, which includes KREF's common stock.""

The numeral in the sentence is: $0.01

The context of the sentence is related to the redemption of SNVPS or liquidation of KREF, which involves payment to the holder of SNVPS. This is related to the concept of ""Preferred Stock"" or ""Preferred Stock Redemption"" in accounting.

Based on the XBRL taxonomy, the corresponding tag for ""Preferred Stock Redemption"" or ""Preferred Stock"" is ""us-gaap:PreferredStockRedeemable"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""payment of $0.01 per share"", it is more related to the ""Dividend"" or ""Dividend Per Share"" concept. The XBRL tag for ""Dividend Per Share"" is ""us-gaap:DividendPerShare"".

Therefore, the associated XBRL tag for the numeral $0.01 is: ""us-gaap:DividendPerShare""

The $10.9 million fair value of the contingent consideration element as of the acquisition date was estimated by applying the income approach based on a discounted cash flow technique using Monte Carlo simulations.,[10.9],Ciena Corp,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral**

The sentence mentions ""the fair value of the contingent consideration element"" and ""the income approach based on a discounted cash flow technique using Monte Carlo simulations."" This suggests that the numeral is related to a financial transaction or valuation.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag**

Based on the context, the numeral is likely related to a financial transaction or valuation, specifically the fair value of a contingent consideration element. The XBRL tag that corresponds to this context is likely ""us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementFairValueInputs"".

From the input sentence:
""As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated balance sheets included a $57.6 million asset due to the consolidation of this VIE included within property, plant and equipment, net.""

The context of the numeral 57.6 is related to an asset due to the consolidation of a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) within property, plant and equipment, net.

Based on this context, the relevant XBRL tag is:
- us-gaap:InvestmentInUnconsolidatedCollateralizedLoanOrOtherOffBalanceSheetAssets

However, since the numeral is related to the consolidation of a VIE within property, plant and equipment, net, a more specific tag would be:
- us-gaap:InvestmentInUnconsolidatedCollateralizedLoanOrOtherOffBalanceSheetAssets

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is related to operating leases, which is typically reported under the US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) tag ""us-gaap:OperatingLeases"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions additions to ROU (Right-of-Use) assets, we need to consider the tag for ROU assets. The correct tag for ROU assets is ""us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentProperty"", but since the context is about operating leases, we should consider the tag for the related party transaction, which is ""us-gaap:OperatingLeaseLiability"" or ""us-gaap:OperatingLeaseAsset"" but more specifically for the context of the question, it is ""us-gaap:OperatingLeaseAsset"" is not the correct answer, the

"Equity in earnings of certain of our joint ventures includes the amortization of the Company’s excess purchase price of $25,251 of these equity investments over its original basis.",[],EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the XBRL tag based on the context.

From the sentence: ""Equity in earnings of certain of our joint ventures includes the amortization of the Company’s excess purchase price of $25,251 of these equity investments over its original basis.""

The numeral in the sentence is: 25,251

The context of the numeral is the ""excess purchase price"" of the equity investments. This is related to the financial statement item ""Investment in Joint Ventures"" and more specifically, the ""Amortization of Excess Purchase Price"" which is a component of the ""Investment in Joint Ventures"" line item.

Based on the XBRL taxonomy, the corresponding tag for the ""Amortization of Excess Purchase Price"" is ""us-gaap:InvestmentInJointVenturesAmortizationOfExcessPurchasePrice"".

However, since the sentence does not explicitly mention the ""Amortization of Excess Purchase Price"" but rather the ""amortization"" of the excess purchase price, we can infer that the numeral 25,251 is related to the ""Investment in Joint Ventures"" line item.

The XBRL tag for the ""Investment in Joint Ventures"" line item is ""us-gaap:InvestmentInJointVentures"".

Therefore, the associated XBRL tag for the numeral 25,251 is ""us-gaap:InvestmentInJointVentures"".

   - Since the costs are net of accumulated amortization, the tag ""us-gaap:AccumulatedAmortizationOfDeferredDebtIssuanceCosts"" might be relevant.
   - The costs are related to a revolver, which is a type of debt instrument, so the tag ""us-gaap:DebtInstrument"" might be relevant.
3. Identify the XBRL tags for the numerals:
   - The numerals 0.6 and 0.8 are associated with the deferred financing costs, so they should be linked to the tag ""us-gaap:DeferredDebtIssuanceCosts"".

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Input Analysis:**

The sentence is: ""In conjunction with Diamondback’s acquisition of the Fasken Center, the Company allocated the $110 million purchase price between real estate assets and an insignificant amount of intangible lease assets related to in-place and above-market leases.""

The numeral is: 110.0

The context is: The numeral represents the purchase price of the Fasken Center.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to the purchase price of an asset. In this case, the purchase price is a non-current asset, so the XBRL tag should be related to non-current assets.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**

The XBRL tag for non-current assets is ""us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentNet"" or ""us-gaap:InvestmentInRealEstate"" depending on the type of asset. However, since the purchase price is allocated between real estate assets and intangible lease assets, we need to consider the specific type of asset.

For real estate assets, the XBRL tag is ""us-gaap:InvestmentInRealEstate"". For intangible lease assets, the XBRL tag is not directly related to the purchase price, but rather to the lease assets themselves.

However, since the purchase price is allocated between real estate assets and intangible lease assets, we can use the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:PurchasePrice"" which is a more general tag that can be used for the purchase price of any asset.

"Debt issued to retire $150 million of pollution control bonds, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.",[150.0],DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Sentence:** Debt issued to retire $150 million of pollution control bonds, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.

**Numerals:** [150.0]
**Company:** DUKE ENERGY CORPORATION
**Document Type:** 10-K

**Analysis:**

- The sentence mentions debt issuance for various purposes, including retiring pollution control bonds and paying down short-term debt. This implies that the debt issuance is related to financing activities.
- The XBRL tag for debt issuance related to financing activities is typically ""us-gaap:DebtIssuanceCosts"".

However, since the debt issuance is also related to retiring pollution control bonds, which is a specific type of asset, we need to consider the ""us-gaap:ProceedsFromSaleOfPropertyPlantAndEquipment"" tag for the amount related to the sale of pollution control bonds. But in this case, the sentence mentions debt issuance, not sale of assets. Therefore, we will use the ""us-gaap:DebtIssuanceCosts"" tag for the entire amount.

"Special mention loans increased $16.5 million to $103.9 million at December 31, 2019 due to downgrades as a result of updated financial information.",[103.9],"S&T BANCORP, INC.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Sentence:** Special mention loans increased $16.5 million to $103.9 million at December 31, 2019 due to downgrades as a result of updated financial information.

**Numerals:** [16.5, 103.9]
**Company:** S&T BANCORP, INC.
**Document Type:** 10-K

**Analysis:**

- The sentence mentions ""Special mention loans,"" which is related to the financial health of the company. This is likely related to the ""Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses"" or ""Allowance for Credit Losses"" in the financial statements.
- The numerals 16.5 and 103.9 are likely related to the increase in special mention loans.

**XBRL Tags:**

- For the numeral 16.5, which represents the increase in special mention loans, the corresponding XBRL tag is likely ""us-gaap:AllowanceForLoanAndLeaseLosses"".
- For the numeral 103.9, which represents the total amount of special mention loans, the corresponding XBRL tag is likely ""us-gaap:AllowanceForLoanAndLeaseLosses"" or ""us-gaap:AllowanceForCreditLosses"".

However, since the numeral 103.9 is the total amount of special mention loans, it is more likely to be associated with the ""us-gaap:AllowanceForLoanAndLeaseLosses"" tag.

"The Interface Pension Plans' liability, net of tax, included in other comprehensive income increased by $0.3 million at December31, 2019.",[0.3],LYDALL INC /DE/,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**

The sentence is: ""The Interface Pension Plans' liability, net of tax, included in other comprehensive income increased by $0.3 million at December 31, 2019.""

The numeral in the sentence is $0.3 million, which represents an increase in liability.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.**

Based on the context, the numeral $0.3 million represents an increase in liability, which is related to other comprehensive income. The relevant XBRL tag for this context is ""us-gaap:OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossBeforeTax"".

However, since the increase is specifically related to a liability, we need to consider the ""us-gaap:OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossBeforeTax"" tag's child element, which is ""us-gaap:OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossBeforeTaxNetOfTaxEffectOfReclassifications"".

But since the increase is specifically related to a pension plan, we need to consider the ""us-gaap:OtherComprehensiveIncomeLossBeforeTaxNetOfTaxEffectOfReclassifications"" tag's child element, which is ""us-gaap:DefinedBenefitPlanOtherComprehensiveIncomeLossBeforeTaxNetOfTaxEffectOfReclassifications"".

However, the most specific tag for the given context is ""us-gaap:DefinedBenefitPlanOtherComprehensiveIncomeLossBeforeTaxNetOfTaxEffectOfReclassifications"" is not the most accurate tag for the given context. The most accurate tag for the given context is ""us-gaap:DefinedBenefitPlanPensionExpense"".

**Sentence Analysis:**
In connection with the 2019-3 Term Loan Repayment, the Company expensed $15.2 million of previously deferred financing costs and $29.9 million of original issue discount.

**Context:** The sentence describes a loan repayment and the associated expenses, specifically deferred financing costs and original issue discount.

**Type of Expense:**
- Deferred financing costs are typically reported as a reduction of debt issuance costs, which is a component of debt discount or premium.
- Original issue discount is also related to debt issuance costs.

**XBRL Tags:**
- For deferred financing costs: us-gaap:DebtIssuanceCosts
- For original issue discount: us-gaap:DebtDiscount

However, since the original issue discount is a component of the debt discount, we can use the us-gaap:DebtDiscount tag for the $29.9 million.

The intangible assets will be amortized over a period of 2 to 15 years.,[2.0],BorgWarner Inc.,10-K,"Based on the input, I will analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag.

**Sentence:** The intangible assets will be amortized over a period of 2 to 15 years.

From the sentence, we can infer that the numeral 2.0 is related to the amortization period of intangible assets.

"Accounts receivable, net of allowances for doubtful accounts of $2.9 and $2.4, respectively","[2.9, 2.4]",FEDERAL SIGNAL CORPORATION,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding financial XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence is discussing accounts receivable, which is a current asset account.
2. Determine the XBRL tag for accounts receivable: The XBRL tag for accounts receivable is typically ""us-gaap:AccountsReceivable"".
3. Identify the context of the allowances for doubtful accounts: The allowances for doubtful accounts are a reduction of the accounts receivable, so the XBRL tag should be related to the reduction or allowance.
4. Determine the XBRL tag for the allowance: The XBRL tag for the allowance for doubtful accounts is typically ""us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts"".

However, since the sentence mentions ""net of allowances"", we need to consider the XBRL tag for the net amount. The net amount is the original amount minus the allowance. In this case, the original amount is not provided, but we can infer that the net amount is the accounts receivable minus the allowance.

5. Determine the XBRL tag for the net amount: The XBRL tag for the net amount is typically ""us-gaap:AccountsReceivableNet"".

6. Associate the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags:
- The first numeral, 2.9, is the allowance for doubtful accounts, so it should be associated with ""us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts"".

The sentence mentions a ""redemption price"" and ""outstanding principal amount."" The redemption price is 100% of the outstanding principal amount, which implies that the redemption price is equal to the outstanding principal amount. The context suggests that this is related to a financial instrument, likely a debt instrument.

Based on the XBRL taxonomy, the ""outstanding principal amount"" is typically associated with the ""us-gaap:DebtIssuanceCosts"" or ""us-gaap:DebtInstrument"" tag. However, since the redemption price is 100% of the outstanding principal amount, it is more likely related to the ""us-gaap:DebtInstrument"" tag.

The ""adjusted Treasury Rate"" is not a standard XBRL tag, but it can be associated with the ""us-gaap:InterestRate"" tag. The ""50 basis points"" is a percentage, which can be associated with the ""us-gaap:Percentage"" tag.

The ""make-whole payment"" is a type of payment made to compensate for the early redemption of a debt instrument. This can be associated with the ""us-gaap:DebtIssuanceCosts"" tag.

"The remaining unamortized deferred gain as of December 31, 2018 was $16.4 million, which is expected to be earned over the next several years.",[16.4],ASSURANT INC,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**

The sentence is: ""The remaining unamortized deferred gain as of December 31, 2018 was $16.4 million, which is expected to be earned over the next several years.""

The numeral in the sentence is: 16.4

The context of the numeral is: deferred gain, which is a non-operating item.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.**

Based on the context of deferred gain, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to non-operating income or loss.

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.**

After analyzing the context and relevant XBRL tags, I found a suitable match:

**Sentence:** As part of the business integration of some of our prior acquisitions, we undertook corporate restructurings in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 that involved on-shoring certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the United States.These restructurings resulted in a cash tax liability of $231 million.

**Numerals:** [231.0]
**Company:** Agilent Technologies, Inc.
**Document Type:** 10-K

**Context Analysis:**
The sentence mentions ""cash tax liability,"" which is a financial concept related to income taxes. This is a key point in determining the XBRL tag.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**
Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to income taxes. In the US GAAP taxonomy, the tag for ""Income Taxes"" is ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpense"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""cash tax liability,"" a more specific tag would be ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxPayable"" or ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpense"" could be used but the more specific tag for cash tax liability is ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxPayable"".

**Mapping:**
The numeral 231.0 is associated with the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxPayable"".

**Output:**

Based on the input sentence and metadata, I will analyze the sentence as follows:

**Sentence:** The estimated fair value of the Company's senior long-term debt and other debt was $3.9 billion and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

**Context:** The sentence is discussing the estimated fair value of the Company's debt, which is a financial liability. This context suggests that the XBRL tags related to debt or liabilities will be relevant.

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**

The sentence is: ""As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 31%.""

The numeral in the sentence is ""31.0"" and it represents a percentage value, specifically a debt-to-capitalization ratio.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.**

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is related to financial ratios, specifically a debt-to-capitalization ratio. The XBRL tag for this is ""us-gaap:DebtToEquityRatio"".

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.**

The numeral ""31.0"" represents the debt-to-capitalization ratio, so it should be mapped to the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:DebtToEquityRatio"".

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence is discussing inventory provisions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
2. Identify the XBRL tags related to inventory provisions: The relevant XBRL tags for inventory provisions are typically related to inventory costs or provisions.
3. Map the numerals to the corresponding XBRL tags based on the context.

Based on the XBRL taxonomy, the relevant tags for inventory provisions are:

- us-gaap:InventoryProvisions

However, since the sentence mentions ""inventory provisions totaling"" which implies a specific type of provision, we need to consider more specific tags. 

- us-gaap:InventoryProvisionsFromCostOfSales
- us-gaap:InventoryProvisionsFromLowerOfCostOrNetRealizableValue

Given the context, it seems more likely that the provisions are related to the lower of cost or net realizable value (LCNRV) method, which is a common method for inventory valuation.

Therefore, the XBRL tags for the numerals are:

- 45,375: us-gaap:InventoryProvisionsFromLowerOfCostOrNetRealizableValue
- 38,902: us-gaap:InventoryProvisionsFromLowerOfCostOrNetRealizableValue

1. Identify the context of the sentence to determine the relevant XBRL tag.
2. Use my knowledge of XBRL tags to match the numerals with the corresponding tags.

From the sentence: ""The aggregate carrying value of PMI’s debt, excluding short-term borrowings and $56 million of finance leases, was $30,651 million at December 31, 2019.""

I can identify the context as follows:

- The sentence is discussing the carrying value of debt, which is a financial concept related to the balance sheet.
- The numerals mentioned are $56 million and $30,651 million, which are amounts related to the carrying value of debt.

Based on this context, I will match the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags:

- $56 million: This is a component of the carrying value of debt, which is related to the ""us-gaap:Debt"" concept. However, since it's a component of the carrying value, it's more specific to ""us-gaap:DebtComponent"".
- $30,651 million: This is the total carrying value of debt, which is related to the ""us-gaap:Debt"" concept.

However, since the question asks for the tag for the $56 million, I will use the tag for the component of debt, which is ""us-gaap:DebtComponent"".

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral**

The sentence is: ""As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated fair value of the AirTouch preferred stock was $1.7 billion.""

The numeral is: 1.7 billion

The context is: Estimated fair value of AirTouch preferred stock.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag**

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to the fair value of an investment or a financial instrument. In this case, the AirTouch preferred stock is a type of investment, so the XBRL tag should be related to investments.

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag**

Based on the context and the company (COMCAST CORPORATION), I will search for the relevant XBRL tag. After searching, I found the following XBRL tag:

- ""us-gaap:InvestmentInAffiliates""

This tag is related to investments in affiliates, which includes preferred stock. However, since the AirTouch preferred stock is not an affiliate of Comcast, I will look for a more specific tag.

After further research, I found the following XBRL tag:

- ""us-gaap:AvailableForSaleSecurities""

This tag is related to available-for-sale securities, which includes investments in securities that are not held for trading or held-to-maturity. Since the AirTouch preferred stock is not held for trading or held-to-maturity, this tag is a good fit.

However, the tag ""us-gaap:AvailableForSaleSecurities"" is not the most specific tag for the context. A more specific tag would be:

"Long-term debt, excluding current portion, including $0 and $15,000, respectively, held by a related party",[0.0],CARVANA CO.,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Sentence:** Long-term debt, excluding current portion, including $0 and $15,000, respectively, held by a related party
**Numerals:** [0.0, 15000.0]
**Company:** CARVANA CO.
**Document Type:** 10-K

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**
The numerals are associated with long-term debt, which is a financial liability.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.**
Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is related to long-term debt. In XBRL, the tag for long-term debt is typically ""us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent"".

However, since the sentence mentions ""excluding current portion"", it implies that the debt is non-current. Therefore, the more specific tag is ""us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent"".

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.**
Since the numerals are associated with long-term debt, I will map them to the corresponding XBRL tag.

- $0: us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent
- $15,000: us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent

However, since the numerals are associated with the ""current portion"" is excluded, the more specific tag is not applicable. The more general tag ""us-gaap:LongTermDebt"" is more suitable.

- $0: us-gaap:LongTermDebt
- $15,000: us-gaap:LongTermDebt

3. Map the concept to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Sentence Analysis:**
""Additionally, accumulated net unrealized investment gains that have arisen subsequent to the establishment of the Closed Block have been reflected as a policyholder dividend obligation of $3,332 million and $899 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, to be paid to Closed Block policyholders unless offset by future experience, with a corresponding amount reported in AOCI.""

**Context:**
The context of the numerals is ""policyholder dividend obligation"" and ""accumulated net unrealized investment gains.""

**Relevant Financial Concept:**
Based on the context, the relevant financial concept is ""Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)"" and ""Policyholder Dividend Obligation.""

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**
The corresponding XBRL tags for the relevant financial concepts are:

- ""Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI)"" is typically reported under ""us-gaap:AccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeLoss"" or ""us-gaap:AccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncome"".
- ""Policyholder Dividend Obligation"" is typically reported under ""us-gaap:PolicyholderDividendObligation"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""policyholder dividend obligation"" and ""accumulated net unrealized investment gains,"" it is more likely that the numerals are related to the ""Policyholder Dividend Obligation"" concept.

**Numerals and XBRL Tags:**
Based on the analysis, the numeral ""899.0"" is associated with the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:PolicyholderDividendObligation"".

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence mentions investment impairments, which is related to the financial statement of income.
2. Identify the type of expense: The sentence mentions ""investment impairments,"" which is a type of expense related to the impairment of investments.
3. Identify the XBRL tag for the expense: Based on the context and type of expense, the XBRL tag for investment impairments is likely to be ""us-gaap:InvestmentImpairmentLosses"".

However, since the sentence mentions ""other-than-temporary declines in value"" for two different types of investments, we need to identify the specific XBRL tags for each type of investment.

4. Identify the XBRL tags for the specific types of investments:
   - Equity method investment: The XBRL tag for the impairment of an equity method investment is likely to be ""us-gaap:InvestmentImpairmentLossesFromEquityMethodInvestments"".

Identify the XBRL tags for the context:\n   - The gain on derivatives is likely related to the ""us-gaap:GainLossOnDerivatives"" tag.\n   - The hedge of the purchase price is likely related to the ""us-gaap:GainLossOnDerivativesHedging"" tag.\n   - The recognition of the gain in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is likely related to the ""us-gaap:OtherIncomeExpenseNet"" tag.\n\n3. Analyze the sentence to determine the XBRL tags for the numerals:\n   - The numeral 9.9 million is likely related to the gain on derivatives, so it should be associated with the ""us-gaap:GainLossOnDerivatives"" tag.\n   - The numeral 0.3 million is likely related to the recognition of the gain in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, so it should be associated with the ""us-gaap:OtherIncomeExpenseNet"" tag.\n\n4. Based on the analysis, the XBRL tags for the numerals are:\n   - 9.9: us-gaap:GainLossOnDerivatives\n   - 0.3: us-gaap:OtherIncomeExpenseNet\n\nHere is the output in JSON format:\n\n```json\n{""9.9"": ""us-gaap:GainLossOnDerivatives"", ""0.3"": ""us-gaap:OtherIncomeExpenseNet""}\n```', tool_calls=[]))] prompt=[] usage=UsageData(prompt_tokens=339, completion_tokens=376, total_tokens=715)","{

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence is discussing the ownership percentage of Entergy Corporation's Union Units.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag: Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to ownership or investment.

From the XBRL taxonomy, I found the following tags that match the context:
- us-gaap:OwnershipPercentage

However, since the sentence is discussing the ownership percentage of specific units, I will use the more specific tag:
- us-gaap:OwnershipPercentageOfParent

3. Associate the numerals with the XBRL tags:
- The numerals 100.0, 100.0, and 100.0 are associated with the ownership percentage of the Union Units, so they will be associated with the us-gaap:OwnershipPercentageOfParent tag.

Output:
```json

**Sentence Analysis:**
- The sentence mentions two types of transactions: 
  1. Commercial business accounts receivable sold to Synchrony.
  2. Losses recognized on these receivable sales.

**Identifying XBRL Tags:**

1. **Commercial business accounts receivable sold to Synchrony:**
   - This is related to the sale of accounts receivable, which is a non-current asset. The relevant XBRL tag for this is `us-gaap:AccountsReceivable`.
   - However, since the question asks for the amount sold, we need to look for a tag related to the sale of accounts receivable. The relevant tag is `us-gaap:SalesRevenueFromRelatedParty`.

2. **Losses recognized on these receivable sales:**
   - The losses are related to servicing costs that are remitted to Synchrony monthly. This is a type of selling, general, and administrative expense. The relevant XBRL tag for this is `us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionSellingGeneralAndAdministrativeExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty`.

**Associating Numerals with XBRL Tags:**

- The numerals in the sentence are [3.3 billion, 3.2 billion, 3.1 billion] for the accounts receivable sold and [54 million, 41 million, 41 million] for the losses recognized.

- **Accounts Receivable Sold:**
  - The numerals [3.3 billion, 3.2 billion, 3.1 billion] are associated with the sale of accounts receivable. However, the question asks for the amount sold, which is not directly available in the provided sentence. We can assume that the amount sold is the same as the amount of accounts receivable sold, which is not the case here. However, we can associate the numerals with the tag `us-gaap:AccountsReceivable` for the beginning balance of accounts receivable.

- **Losses Recognized:**
  - The numerals [54 million, 41 million, 41 million] are associated with the losses recognized on the receivable sales. These are related to servicing costs that are remitted to Synchrony monthly. The relevant XBRL tag is `us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionSellingGeneralAndAdministrativeExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty`.

**Output:**

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence is about the Company pledging assets and providing security in the form of a bond and cash deposit.

   - For the bond, the XBRL tag is likely related to ""Long-term debt"" or ""Debt"".

Based on the context and the company's financial reporting requirements, I will use the following XBRL tags:

- For the bond: ""us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent""
- For the cash deposit: ""us-gaap:CashAndCashEquivalents""

However, since the numeral 78.0 is associated with the bond, I will use the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent"" for this numeral.

The numeral 3 is associated with the cash deposit, but since the cash deposit is a small amount, it is likely a ""Cash and cash equivalents"" component, but not a primary component.

""In addition, AROs at December 31, 2019 include $2.6 billion related to Virginia Power’s future ash pond and landfill closure costs.""

**Context:** The numeral 2.6 billion is related to ""AROs"" (Asset Retirement Obligations) at a specific date (December 31, 2019), which implies it's a long-term liability.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**
Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to ""Long-term liabilities"" or ""Asset Retirement Obligations."" In the US GAAP taxonomy, the most suitable tag for this context is ""us-gaap:AssetRetirementObligations"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""ash pond and landfill closure costs,"" which are related to environmental liabilities, a more specific tag might be more suitable. In this case, the tag ""us-gaap:AssetRetirementObligations"" is still a good fit, but we can also consider ""us-gaap:AssetRetirementObligationsCurrent"" or ""us-gaap:AssetRetirementObligationsNoncurrent"" depending on the specific accounting treatment.

**Mapping the Numeral to XBRL Tag:**
Based on the analysis, the numeral 2.6 billion is associated with the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:AssetRetirementObligations"".

**Sentence Analysis:**
The sentence describes the estimated prior service (credit) for pension benefits that will be amortized from Accumulated other comprehensive (income) loss into net periodic benefit (income) cost in 2020. It mentions two amounts: $(42) million and $0 million, which are related to U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, respectively.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**
Based on the context, the XBRL tags for the given numerals can be identified as follows:

- $(42) million: This amount is related to the U.S. pension plan, which is a type of related-party transaction. Therefore, the XBRL tag for this amount is ""us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionPensionAndOtherPostretirementBenefitExpenseComponents"".
- $0 million: This amount is related to the non-U.S. pension plan, which is also a type of related-party transaction. Therefore, the XBRL tag for this amount is the same as the first amount, ""us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionPensionAndOtherPostretirementBenefitExpenseComponents"".

**Analysis:**

- The numeral 500 million is associated with the borrowing under the Term Loan Facility.

From the sentence: ""As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of this contingent consideration obligation was $259.8 million and $244.6 million, respectively.""

I can identify the context as follows:
- The sentence is discussing the fair value of a contingent consideration obligation.
- The numerals are associated with the years 2020 and 2019.

Based on this context, I will match the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags.

For the numeral 259.8, the XBRL tag is likely related to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation.

3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

From the input sentence: ""Pollution control and industrial revenue bonds (less unamortized discounts of $0.1 and $0.2, respectively)""

The context of the numerals is ""unamortized discounts"" which is related to the financial statement item ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net"" or ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net - Net of Accumulated Depreciation"" in the context of a 10-K filing.

Based on the XBRL taxonomy, the relevant tag for ""unamortized discounts"" is likely ""us-gaap:AccumulatedAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets"" or ""us-gaap:AccumulatedAmortizationOfPropertyPlantAndEquipment"".

However, since the context is specifically about ""unamortized discounts"" related to ""Pollution control and industrial revenue bonds"", it is more likely that the correct tag is ""us-gaap:AccumulatedAmortizationOfIntangibleAssets"" or ""us-gaap:AccumulatedAmortizationOfPropertyPlantAndEquipment"" is not the best fit.

The sentence is: ""A valuation allowance of $49 million is attributable to state net operating loss carryforward benefits primarily attributable to significant restrictions on their use in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.""

The numeral is: 49.0

The context of the sentence is related to a valuation allowance, which is typically associated with income taxes. In XBRL, the tag for income taxes is ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpense"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""state net operating loss carryforward benefits"", it is more related to the ""us-gaap:DeferredTaxAssets"" or ""us-gaap:DeferredTaxLiabilities"" tag.

1. Identify the context of the numerals in the sentence.
2. Determine the XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numerals**

The sentence mentions ""Comprehensive income"" and lists three numerals ($104.3 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion) for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. This implies that the numerals are related to comprehensive income.

**Step 2: Determine the XBRL tag**

Based on the context, the XBRL tag for comprehensive income is likely to be related to income statement items. In XBRL, comprehensive income is typically reported as a component of net income. The XBRL tag for net income is ""us-gaap:NetIncomeLoss"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""Comprehensive income"", we need to look for a tag that is a component of net income. The XBRL tag for comprehensive income is ""us-gaap:ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax"".

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag**

Based on the context and the XBRL tag determined in the previous step, we can map the numerals to the corresponding XBRL tags as follows:

- $104.3 million: us-gaap:ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax
- $1.5 billion: us-gaap:ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax
- $1.5 billion: us-gaap:ComprehensiveIncomeNetOfTax

However, since the numerals are for different years, we need to consider the XBRL tag for the specific component of comprehensive income. In this case, the numerals are likely related to the ""Net income"" component of comprehensive income. Therefore, we can map the numerals to the corresponding XBRL tags as follows:

- $104.3 million: us-gaap:NetIncomeLoss
- $1.5 billion: us-gaap:NetIncomeLoss
- $1.5 billion: us-gaap:NetIncomeLoss

"The allowance for doubtful accounts was $2.8 million and $0.3 million at December31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.","[2.8, 0.3]","Assurant, Inc.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding financial XBRL tag, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence.
2. Determine the type of financial information being presented.
3. Match the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags based on the context.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the sentence**

The sentence is discussing the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is a component of a company's financial statements, specifically the balance sheet.

**Step 2: Determine the type of financial information being presented**

The sentence is presenting the allowance for doubtful accounts at two different points in time (December 31, 2019, and 2018).

**Step 3: Match the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags**

Based on the context, the XBRL tags for the allowance for doubtful accounts are:

- `us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts`

However, since the sentence is presenting the allowance for doubtful accounts at two different points in time, we need to consider the XBRL tags for the balance sheet line item and the XBRL tags for the date.

- `us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts` is the XBRL tag for the balance sheet line item.
- `us-gaap:BalanceSheet` is the XBRL tag for the balance sheet.
- `us-gaap:AsOfDate` is the XBRL tag for the date.

Since the sentence is presenting the allowance for doubtful accounts at two different points in time, we can use the `us-gaap:AsOfDate` tag to specify the date.

**XBRL Tags**

- `2.8`: `us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts us-gaap:AsOfDate=2019-12-31`
- `0.3`: `us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts us-gaap:AsOfDate=2018-12-31`

However, the XBRL tags should be in the format of a single string, so we can combine the tags as follows:

- `2.8`: `us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts us-gaap:AsOfDate=2019-12-31`
- `0.3`: `us-gaap:AllowanceForDoubtfulAccounts us-gaap:AsOfDate=2018-12-31`

**Step 1: Identify the context of the sentence**

The sentence mentions ""PCI loans"" and ""ASC 310-30,"" which indicates that it's related to financial instruments and accounting standards.

**Step 2: Determine the type of financial information being presented**

The sentence is discussing the carrying value of loans, which is a financial asset. This is likely related to the ""Loans and Debt Securities"" section of the financial statements.

**Step 3: Match the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags**

Based on the context, the numerals are likely related to the carrying value of the loans. The XBRL tag for the carrying value of loans is ""us-gaap:LoansNet"" or ""us-gaap:LoansNetCarryingValue"".

However, since the sentence mentions ""ASC 310-30"", which is related to ""Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality"", the XBRL tag is more specific to the type of loans being discussed.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numerals**

The sentence mentions ""outstanding loan and lease balances"" which implies that the numerals are related to financial instruments. The context is likely related to the company's financial position or performance.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag**

"This multi-tenant mortgage loan is interest-only with a principal balance due on maturity, and it is secured by seven properties in six states, totaling approximately 651,313 square feet.",[],"Global Net Lease, Inc.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I'll break down the sentence into its key components:

- The sentence mentions a multi-tenant mortgage loan with a principal balance due on maturity.
- It also mentions the number of properties and states, but these are not financial numerals.
- The sentence mentions a total area of approximately 651,313 square feet.

Based on the context, the numeral 651,313 is a non-financial measure (area in square feet) and does not have a corresponding XBRL tag in the financial context. However, if we were to consider the XBRL tag for non-financial measures, it could be something like ""unit:PhysicalMeasureOfArea"".

The sentence mentions ""dividend income of $220 million from our investment in ViiV."" This implies that the $220 million is related to dividend income. In XBRL, dividend income is typically reported under the tag ""us-gaap:DividendIncomeFromInvestmentsInAffiliates"".

However, since the sentence also mentions ""charges of $152 million for external incremental costs"" and ""net losses on early retirement of debt of $138 million"", which are not directly related to dividend income, we need to identify the correct XBRL tags for these amounts.

The ""charges of $152 million for external incremental costs"" are likely related to ""us-gaap:CostsRelatedToBusinessCombinations"" or ""us-gaap:TransactionAndIntegrationCosts"", but without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact tag.

**Numerals:** [14.0]
**Company:** NEWELL BRANDS INC.
**Document Type:** 10-K

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**
The numeral 14 million is associated with ""interest expense, net"" in the context of the sentence.

**Step 2: Determine the type of financial information being described.**
The numeral is related to interest expense, which is a component of operating expenses.

**Step 3: Match the context with the relevant XBRL tag.**
Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is ""us-gaap:InterestExpense"" for interest expense. However, since it's ""net"" interest expense, we need to consider the XBRL tag for net interest expense, which is ""us-gaap:InterestExpenseNetOfInterestIncome"".

The sentence mentions ""non-recurring income tax benefit"" which is related to income tax. In XBRL, income tax is typically reported under the ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpense"" or ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxBenefit"" tag. However, since it's a non-recurring income tax benefit, it's more likely to be reported under ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxBenefitFromContinuingOperations"".

3. Identify the specific XBRL tag for the expense or transaction: Based on the context and type of expense, I will look for the corresponding XBRL tag.

Based on the XBRL taxonomy, I will use the following tags:

- us-gaap:AccountsPayable (for accounts payable)
- us-gaap:AccruedLiabilities (for accrued liabilities)
- us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionAccountsPayable (for related party accounts payable)
- us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionAccruedLiabilities (for related party accrued liabilities)

""In the fourth quarter of 2017 the Company recorded a charge of $47.0 million as a provisional reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $49.0 million for the Toll Charge net of $2.0 million for other net tax benefits.""

- The charge is related to the Tax Act, which is a tax-related event.
- The charge is a provisional estimate, which is a non-operating item.
- The charge is recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, which is a specific period.

"Other intangibles, net of amortization of $403,347 and $333,507",[],THE MIDDLEBY CORPORATION,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the type of expense or transaction being described.
3. Match the context with the relevant XBRL tag.

The sentence is: ""Other intangibles, net of amortization of $403,347 and $333,507""

From the sentence, we can infer that the numerals 403,347 and 333,507 are related to the amortization of intangibles.

Based on the context, the XBRL tag for amortization of intangibles is likely ""us-gaap:IntangibleAssetsAmortizationExpense"".

However, since the sentence mentions ""net of amortization,"" it's more likely that the correct tag is ""us-gaap:IntangibleAssetsAmortizationExpense"" is not the correct tag, but rather the tag for the net amount after amortization, which is ""us-gaap:IntangibleAssetsNet"".

The correct XBRL tags for the numerals are:

- 403,347: us-gaap:IntangibleAssetsNet
- 333,507: us-gaap:IntangibleAssetsNet

The Company recorded a $221.8 million multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to Safeway's withdrawal from these plans.,[221.8],"Albertsons Companies, Inc.",10-K,"Based on the provided information, I will analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag.

**Sentence:** The Company recorded a $221.8 million multiemployer pension withdrawal liability related to Safeway's withdrawal from these plans.

**Numerals:** [221.8]

**Company:** Albertsons Companies, Inc.

**Document Type:** 10-K

**Analysis:**

The sentence mentions a multiemployer pension withdrawal liability, which is related to a specific type of expense. In XBRL, this type of expense is typically reported under the tag ""us-gaap:MultiemployerPensionWithdrawalLiability"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions a ""multiemployer pension withdrawal liability"" and the amount is related to a withdrawal from plans, it is more likely that the expense is related to ""us-gaap:MultiemployerPensionWithdrawalLiability"" but in this context, it is more likely to be reported under ""us-gaap:MultiemployerPensionWithdrawalLiabilityCost"".

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the XBRL tag based on the context.

From the input sentence: ""Long-Term Debt (includes $1,002 at 2020 and $1,307 at 2019 related to VIEs)""

The context of the numeral is related to Long-Term Debt, specifically the amounts at 2020 and 2019.

Based on the context, the XBRL tags for the numerals are:

- $1,002: us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent
- $1,307: us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent

However, since the numerals are related to VIEs (Variable Interest Entities), we need to consider the XBRL tag for VIEs. The correct XBRL tag for VIEs is us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrentRelatedParty.

**Numerals:** [175.0]

**Metadata:**
- Company: LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION
- Document Type: 10-K

**Analysis:**
The sentence mentions a decrease in goodwill due to a divestiture, which is a non-operating item. In the context of financial reporting, goodwill is typically reported under the ""Non-Operating Items"" section. The decrease in goodwill is likely related to a non-operating item, such as a gain or loss on sale of a business.

Consumer real estate loans 60-89 days past due includes fully-insured loans of $103 million and nonperforming loans of $95 million.,"[103.0, 95.0]",Bank of America Corporation,10-K,"To analyze the input sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence to determine the relevant XBRL tags.
2. Map the numerals to their corresponding XBRL tags based on the context.

**Step 1: Identify the context**

The sentence mentions ""Consumer real estate loans"" which is related to the financial industry, specifically banking. The context is likely related to the financial performance of Bank of America Corporation.

**Step 2: Map numerals to XBRL tags**

Based on the context, the numerals are likely related to the following XBRL tags:

- $103 million: This is likely related to the ""Nonperforming loans"" mentioned in the sentence. The XBRL tag for nonperforming loans is ""us-gaap:NonperformingLoans"".
- $95 million: This is also related to the ""Nonperforming loans"" mentioned in the sentence. The XBRL tag for nonperforming loans is the same as above, ""us-gaap:NonperformingLoans"".

However, the sentence also mentions ""fully-insured loans"" which is a different type of loan. The XBRL tag for fully-insured loans is not directly related to the nonperforming loans. After further analysis, I found that the XBRL tag for fully-insured loans is not a standard tag, but it can be related to ""us-gaap:LoansPastDue30To89Days"".

However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the $103 million is for fully-insured loans, but rather it is part of the ""Consumer real estate loans 60-89 days past due"". Therefore, I will associate the $103 million with the ""us-gaap:LoansPastDue60To89Days"" tag.

The $95 million is associated with the ""us-gaap:NonperformingLoans"" tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numerals**

From the sentence, we can identify the following contexts for the numerals:

- The first two numerals ($339 million and $342 million) are related to ""other long-term liabilities"" and specifically ""VIE's mortgage note liability.""
- The last two numerals ($11 million and $4 million) are related to ""liability-classified noncontrolling interest recorded at amortized cost with accretion towards settlement of the put/call option in the lease.""

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tags**

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tags are:

- For the first two numerals ($339 million and $342 million), the XBRL tag is likely related to ""Long-term debt"" or ""Long-term liabilities.""
- For the last two numerals ($11 million and $4 million), the XBRL tag is likely related to ""Noncontrolling interest"" or ""Accumulated other comprehensive income.""

**Step 3: Map the numerals to their corresponding XBRL tags**

"On December 1, 2018, certain holders of the Series C Units converted their Series C Units into common OP Units, with a total of 407,996 Series C Units being converted into a total of 373,113 common OP Units.",[],EXTRA SPACE STORAGE INC.,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I'll break down the sentence into its key components:

- The sentence mentions a conversion of Series C Units to common OP Units.
- The conversion occurred on December 1, 2018.
- The total number of Series C Units converted is 407,996.
- The total number of common OP Units received is 373,113.

Since the conversion of Series C Units to common OP Units is a transaction, we can associate the numerals with the XBRL tag for ""Common Stock Issuance"" or ""Common Stock Repurchase"" depending on the context. However, in this case, it's an issuance of common OP Units, so we'll use the ""Common Stock Issuance"" tag.

The XBRL tag for ""Common Stock Issuance"" is ""us-gaap:CommonStockIssuedInExchangeForReacquiredEarnings"".

However, since the conversion is from Series C Units to common OP Units, we need to consider the ""Common Stock Issuance"" in the context of the conversion. In this case, the correct XBRL tag would be ""us-gaap:CommonStockIssuedInExchangeForAcquisitionOfBusiness"".

The correct XBRL tags for the numerals are:

- 407,996: us-gaap:CommonStockIssuedInExchangeForAcquisitionOfBusiness

From the sentence: ""As this loan was contractually required to be repaid with any proceeds received from the sale of PlusServer, interest expense attributable to the loan of $12.4 million in 2017 was recorded within discontinued operations.""

1. The numeral $12.4 million is associated with the interest expense of a loan.
2. The loan is being repaid with proceeds from the sale of PlusServer, which is a discontinued operation.
3. The interest expense is a type of selling, general, and administrative expense (SG&A) related to a related-party transaction.

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is: `us-gaap:InterestExpenseRelatedToDiscontinuedOperations`

However, since the interest expense is related to a discontinued operation, it's more specific than the general `us-gaap:InterestExpense` tag. The `us-gaap:InterestExpenseRelatedToDiscontinuedOperations` tag is a more accurate representation of the context.

For the given sentence:
""Such reserves totaled $138 million and $132 million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.""

**Context Analysis:**
The sentence mentions ""reserves,"" which is a financial concept related to the balance sheet. The XBRL tag for reserves is likely to be related to ""us-gaap:Reserve"" or its sub-elements.

**XBRL Tag Hierarchy:**
The XBRL tag hierarchy for reserves is:
- us-gaap:Reserve
  - us-gaap:AccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncome
  - us-gaap:DeferredTaxAssets
  - us-gaap:DeferredTaxLiabilities
  - us-gaap:OtherReserve

The sentence is: ""KMGP, $1,000 Liquidation Value Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Term Cumulative Preferred Stock, due August 2057(i)""

The numeral in the sentence is: 2057

Metadata:
- Company: Kinder Morgan, Inc.
- Document Type: 10-K

Based on the context, the numeral 2057 is likely referring to the maturity date of the preferred stock. In XBRL, the tag for the maturity date of a debt or equity instrument is typically ""us-gaap:DebtInstrumentMaturityDate"".

However, since the preferred stock is cumulative, it's more likely that the XBRL tag is related to the ""us-gaap:PreferredStockMaturityDate"" or ""us-gaap:PreferredStockRedemptionDate"". But in this case, since the preferred stock is cumulative, the more likely XBRL tag is ""us-gaap:PreferredStockMaturityDate"".

However, since the numeral is specifically related to a discount percentage, a more specific tag is needed. The tag `us-gaap:StockBasedCompensationExpense` has a child element `us-gaap:StockBasedCompensationExpenseDiscountPercentage` which is the most suitable tag for the numeral 15.0.

The sentence mentions ""decrease as much as $4 million"" which implies a decrease in the ""Uncertain Tax Benefits"" (UTBs). In the context of financial reporting, UTBs are related to income tax positions. The XBRL tag for income tax positions is ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit"".

However, the specific tag for uncertain tax benefits is ""us-gaap:UncertainTaxBenefit"". The decrease in UTBs would be a reduction in the uncertain tax benefit, which is a component of income tax expense. Therefore, the XBRL tag for the numeral 4.0 would be ""us-gaap:UncertainTaxBenefit"".

The total cost of the 2023 convertible note hedge transactions was $172.6 million.,[172.6],"SQUARE, INC.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral**

The sentence is: ""The total cost of the 2023 convertible note hedge transactions was $172.6 million.""

The numeral is: 172.6

The context is: The total cost of convertible note hedge transactions.

**Step 2: Determine the relevant XBRL tag**

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to financial instruments or derivatives. In this case, the total cost of convertible note hedge transactions is likely a financial expense.

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag**

Based on the context and the relevant XBRL tag, I will map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

The XBRL tag for the total cost of convertible note hedge transactions is likely: ""us-gaap:DebtInstrumentGainLossFromHedgesDesignatedAsCashFlowHedges""

From the input sentence: ""SunCoke Middletown had income before income taxes of $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was included in our consolidated income before income taxes.""

1. The numeral 41 million is associated with the income before income taxes.
2. The XBRL tag for income before income taxes is typically ""us-gaap:IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesBeforeReclassification"".
3. However, since the income before income taxes is before reclassification, we need to consider the context of the sentence.

The sentence mentions ""deemed repatriation tax"" and ""non-recurring benefit related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends."" This context suggests that the financial information is related to income taxes.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**

- The ""deemed repatriation tax"" is likely related to income tax expense, which can be mapped to the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpense"".
- The ""non-recurring benefit"" is a positive adjustment to the income tax expense, which can be mapped to the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxBenefit"".

However, since the non-recurring benefit is related to the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends, it is more specific to the ""Related Party Transaction"" context. Therefore, it can be mapped to the XBRL tag ""us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionIncomeTaxBenefit"".

The sentence mentions ""approximately 69% and 66% of our total debt had a fixed interest rate at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively."" 

Based on this context, the numerals 69.0 and 66.0 are percentages of total debt with a fixed interest rate.

   - For the reduction in operating expenses: us-gaap:OperatingExpenses
   - For the impact on diluted earnings per share: us-gaap:BasicEPS and us-gaap:DilutedEPS
3. However, the numeral 0.05 is associated with the diluted earnings per share, which is a non-operating expense. Therefore, the correct XBRL tag for 0.05 is us-gaap:IncomeFromContinuingAndDiscontinuedOperationsNetOfTax, which is the parent tag for income from continuing and discontinued operations, net of tax, but more specifically, it is associated with the income from continuing operations, net of tax, which is the parent tag for diluted EPS.

"The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $18, representing a net increase to the ACL and LCL, after tax.",[18.0],"THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Input Analysis:**

- Sentence: The Company adopted the guidance effective January 1, 2020, through a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings by $18, representing a net increase to the ACL and LCL, after tax.
- Numerals: [18.0]
- Company: THE HARTFORD FINANCIAL SERVICES GROUP, INC.
- Document Type: 10-K

**Context Analysis:**

The numeral 18 is associated with a cumulative-effect adjustment that decreased retained earnings. This indicates a change in equity, specifically a decrease in retained earnings.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is related to changes in equity, specifically a decrease in retained earnings. The XBRL tag for this is ""us-gaap:RetainedEarningsAccumulatedBeginningBalance"".

However, since the adjustment is a decrease, we need to consider the opposite of the tag. The correct tag is ""us-gaap:RetainedEarningsAccumulatedBeginningBalanceDecrease"".

"recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements was approximately $4.4 billion, $4.2 billion, and $4.2 billion, respectively.","[4.4, 4.2, 4.2]","ALTRIA GROUP, INC.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence to determine the relevant XBRL tag.
2. Map the context to the corresponding XBRL tag based on the provided metadata and general knowledge of XBRL tags.

**Sentence Analysis:**
The sentence mentions ""cost of sales"" which is a key component of the income statement. In the context of cost of sales, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to the cost of goods sold or cost of sales.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**
Based on the context and general knowledge of XBRL tags, I will map the numerals to the corresponding XBRL tags as follows:

- Numerals: [4.4, 4.2, 4.2]
- XBRL Tags: 
  - ""us-gaap:CostOfSales""

However, since the sentence mentions ""State Settlement Agreements"", it might be related to a specific type of cost of sales, such as ""us-gaap:CostOfSalesFromGovernmentRegulatoryMatters"" or ""us-gaap:CostOfSalesFromGovernmentRegulatoryMattersFromSettlements"". But without more information, I will use the general ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"" tag.

**Output:**
```json
{""4.4"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"", ""4.2"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"", ""4.2"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales""}
```

However, since the output should be unique for each numeral, I will modify the output to include the respective XBRL tag for each numeral.

```json
{""4.4"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"", ""4.2"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"", ""4.2"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales""}

```json
{""4.4"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"", ""4.2"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales"", ""4.2"": ""us-gaap:CostOfSales""}

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral**

The sentence is: ""As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $60.1 million of contingent liabilities on its Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which was long-term.""

The numeral is: $60.1 million

**Step 3: Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag**

After researching the XBRL tags, I found the following possible matches:

- us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent (for long-term liabilities)
- us-gaap:LongTermOtherLiabilities (for other long-term liabilities)
- us-gaap:LongTermOtherLiabilitiesFromUnresolvedCommitments (for contingent liabilities)

"On August 1, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party to sell its Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) business included in Other for $185 million, subject to adjustments for net debt and working capital.",[185.0],McKESSON CORPORATION,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.

**Sentence Analysis:**
""On August 1, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with a third party to sell its Enterprise Information Solutions (“EIS”) business included in Other for $185 million, subject to adjustments for net debt and working capital.""

**Context:** The numeral 185 million is related to the sale of the Enterprise Information Solutions business, which is included in the ""Other"" category. This implies that the numeral is associated with a gain or loss from the sale of a business, which is typically reported under the ""Gain on sale of business"" or ""Loss on sale of business"" line item.

**XBRL Tag:** Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely ""us-gaap:GainOnSaleOfBusiness"" or ""us-gaap:LossOnSaleOfBusiness"". However, since the sentence mentions ""included in Other"", it's more likely that the gain/loss is reported under the ""Other income (expense) - net"" line item, which is typically tagged as ""us-gaap:OtherIncomeExpenseNet"".

**Mapping:**
Since the sentence does not explicitly state whether the sale resulted in a gain or loss, I will assume it's a gain for the purpose of this exercise. However, in a real-world scenario, you would need to review the entire document to determine the correct classification.

**Sentence Analysis:**
The sentence discusses pre-tax gains that were reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Interest Expense.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**

- The pre-tax gains are related to Interest Expense, which is typically reported under the tag ""us-gaap:InterestExpense"".
- The reclassification from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss is related to ""us-gaap:ReclassificationAdjustmentFromAccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeLoss"".

**Numerical Mapping:**

- $0.4 million: This is a reclassification adjustment from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Interest Expense, so it should be mapped to ""us-gaap:ReclassificationAdjustmentFromAccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeLoss"".
- $4.7 million: This is also a reclassification adjustment from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss to Interest Expense, so it should be mapped to ""us-gaap:ReclassificationAdjustmentFromAccumulatedOtherComprehensiveIncomeLoss"".

From the sentence: ""The Company does not believe it is more likely than not that any of the loss carryforwards can be used and has provided a valuation allowance against the tax benefit of the losses in foreign jurisdictions of $3,753 and $474 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.""

1. The context of the numeral 474 is related to the tax benefit of losses in foreign jurisdictions.
2. The relevant XBRL tag for tax benefit of losses in foreign jurisdictions is ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxBenefitFromContinuingOperationsBeforeIncomeTaxExpense"".

However, since the numeral 474 is associated with a valuation allowance, which is a contra-asset account, the correct XBRL tag would be a negative of the income tax benefit. The correct XBRL tag is ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxBenefitFromContinuingOperationsBeforeIncomeTaxExpense"" with a negative sign.

3. Map the numeral 474 to the corresponding XBRL tag: ""-474.0"" to ""us-gaap:IncomeTaxBenefitFromContinuingOperationsBeforeIncomeTaxExpense"".

"On September 30, 2011, the Massachusetts Attorney General, DPU, PURA, New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission, Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, Vermont Department of Public Service, numerous New England consumer advocate agencies and transmission tariff customers collectively filed a joint complaint with the FERC, pursuant to sections 206 and 306 of the Federal Power Act, against several New England Transmission Owners (NETOs) claiming that the approved base ROE of 11.14% used by NETOs in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-New England Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) was not just and reasonable and seeking a reduction of the base ROE with refunds to customers for the 15-month refund periods beginning October 1, 2011 (Complaint I), December 27, 2012 (Complaint II), July 31, 2014 (Complaint III) and April 29, 2016 (Complaint IV).",[11.14],"Avangrid, Inc.",10-K,"To analyze the given sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding financial XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence and the relevant financial information.
2. Determine the XBRL tag for the identified financial information.

From the sentence, I can identify the following relevant information:

- The base ROE (Return on Equity) used by NETOs is 11.14%.
- The base ROE is used in calculating formula rates for transmission service under the ISO-New England Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT).

Based on the context, the XBRL tag for the base ROE is likely related to the ""Return on Equity"" element. In XBRL, the tag for Return on Equity is ""us-gaap:ReturnOnEquity"".

However, since the base ROE is used in calculating formula rates for transmission service, it is more likely related to the ""Revenue"" element, specifically the ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" or ""Revenue from Operations"" element. In XBRL, the tag for Revenue from Contracts with Customers is ""us-gaap:RevenueFromContractsWithCustomers"".

But, in this case, the base ROE is used in calculating the formula rates, so it is more likely related to the ""Revenue"" element, specifically the ""Revenue from Operations"" element. In XBRL, the tag for Revenue from Operations is ""us-gaap:RevenueFromOperations"".

However, the base ROE is used in calculating the formula rates, which is a part of the ""Revenue"" element, but it is more likely related to the ""Revenue"" element, specifically the ""Revenue from Operations"" element, but in this case, it is more likely related to the ""Cost of Revenue"" element, specifically the ""Cost of Revenue from Operations"" element. In XBRL, the tag for Cost of Revenue from Operations is ""us-gaap:CostOfRevenueFromOperations"".

However, the base ROE is used in calculating the formula rates, which is a part of the ""Revenue"" element, but it is more likely related to the ""Revenue"" element, specifically the ""Revenue from Operations"" element, but in this case, it is more likely related to the ""Cost of Revenue"" element, specifically the ""Cost of Revenue from Operations"" element, but in this case, it is more likely related to the ""Operating Expenses"" element, specifically the ""Operating Expenses from Transactions with Related Party"" element. In XBRL, the tag for Operating Expenses from Transactions with Related Party is ""us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionSellingGeneralAndAdministrativeExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty"".

From the sentence: ""Aggregate liquidation preference is $15 million.No Series A Preferred Stock was outstanding in 2019, 2018 or 2017.""

The numeral in the sentence is: 15.0

The context of the numeral is the ""Aggregate liquidation preference,"" which is a financial concept related to the liquidation of a company's assets. Based on this context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to ""Share Capital"" or ""Equity.""

**Sentence Analysis:**
- The sentence mentions the fair value of derivatives included in trading assets at two different dates (December 31, 2020 and 2019).
- It mentions two amounts: $2,763 million and $2,538 million, which are related to the obligation to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**
- The amounts $2,763 million and $2,538 million are related to the fair value of derivatives, which is a financial instrument. In XBRL, this can be associated with the tag ""us-gaap:DerivativeFinancialInstrumentFairValueMeasurement"" or a more specific tag related to the type of financial instrument (e.g., ""us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementFairValueOfDerivativeAssets"").

However, since the amounts are related to the obligation to return cash collateral, a more specific tag would be ""us-gaap:DerivativeFinancialInstrumentFairValueMeasurementFairValueOfDerivativeLiabilities"" or ""us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementFairValueOfDerivativeLiabilities"".

1. Identify the context of the sentence.
2. Determine the type of financial information being presented.
3. Map the numerals to their corresponding XBRL tags based on the context.

**Input Analysis:**

- Sentence: As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the liability balances were $82 million and $84 million.
- Numerals: [82.0]
- Company: CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION
- Document Type: 10-K

**Context Analysis:**

The sentence mentions liability balances as of December 31, 2020, and 2019. This indicates that the financial information is related to the company's balance sheet.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**

Based on the context, the liability balances are likely related to the ""Liabilities"" section of the balance sheet. The XBRL tag for ""Liabilities"" is ""us-gaap:Liabilities"".

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""liability balances"", it's more likely that the XBRL tag is related to a specific type of liability. In this case, the tag ""us-gaap:LongTermDebt"" is a common XBRL tag for long-term liabilities.

The sentence is: (a)As of December31, 2020, $19 of common stock repurchases had not settled, nor been retired, and were recorded as Treasury stock within our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity (deficit).

The numeral is: 19.0

The context of the sentence is related to common stock repurchases, which is typically reported under the account ""Treasury Stock"" in the balance sheet. In XBRL, this account is represented by the tag ""us-gaap:TreasuryStock"".

However, since the numeral 19.0 is related to the amount of common stock repurchases that had not been settled, it is more specific to the ""Common Stock Repurchased"" account, which is a component of Treasury Stock. In XBRL, this account is represented by the tag ""us-gaap:CommonStockRepurchased"".

Therefore, the associated XBRL tag for the numeral 19.0 is ""us-gaap:CommonStockRepurchased"".

The output is:

1. Identify the context of the sentence.

**Sentence Analysis:**
The sentence describes a return of capital contributed under a capital plan by OCC (Nasdaq, Inc.). The return of capital is received in two installments: $44 million in February 2019 and $16 million in November 2019.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**
Based on the context, the return of capital is a type of financing activity. The XBRL tags for financing activities are typically related to cash flows from financing activities. In this case, the return of capital is a cash inflow, so the corresponding XBRL tags are:

- us-gaap:CashFromIssuanceOfCapitalStock (for the $44 million received in February 2019)
- us-gaap:CashFromIssuanceOfCapitalStock (for the $16 million received in November 2019)

However, since the return of capital is not a stock issuance, the correct tag should be us-gaap:CashFromReturnOfCapital.

2. Determine the XBRL tag for the concept: Based on the context, the XBRL tag for amortization of net actuarial costs is likely to be ""us-gaap:NetPeriodicPensionCost"".

However, since the sentence mentions ""net of income taxes"", it is more likely that the XBRL tag is related to the net amount after taxes. In this case, the XBRL tag is likely to be ""us-gaap:NetPeriodicPensionCostNetOfTaxEffectOfTemporaryDifferences"".

3. Identify the XBRL tag for the specific line item: The sentence mentions ""amortization of net actuarial costs"", which is a component of ""net periodic pension cost"". The XBRL tag for this line item is likely to be ""us-gaap:NetActuarialGainLoss"".

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence is discussing the exchange rate of fixed rate payments in different currencies.
2. Determine the XBRL tags for the numerals:
   - The numerals 0.0 and 0.0 represent the lower bound of the exchange rate range in Euros and Japanese Yen, respectively. 
   - The numerals 4.508 and 3.588 represent the upper bound of the exchange rate range in Euros and Japanese Yen, respectively.

Based on the context, the XBRL tags for the numerals are:
- 0.0: ""fx:ExchangeRate""

The numeral 153 million is associated with the context of ""storm costs incurred.""

Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net"" or ""Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization"" as these are common areas where storm costs would be recorded.

However, since the sentence specifically mentions ""storm costs incurred,"" it is more likely related to ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net"" or ""Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization"" which is a part of the ""Property, Plant, and Equipment"" line item.

The XBRL tag for ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net"" is ""us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentNet"" and for ""Accumulated Depreciation, Depletion, and Amortization"" is ""us-gaap:AccumulatedDepreciationDepletionAndAmortization"".

P. Carey Inc.,10-K,"To analyze the input sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence to determine the relevant XBRL tags.
2. Use my knowledge of XBRL tags to match the numerals with the corresponding tags.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the sentence**

The sentence mentions a gain on change in control of interests, which is related to the financial performance of the company. The context is likely related to the income statement, specifically the gain on sale of assets or change in control.

**Step 2: Determine the XBRL tags**

Based on the context, I will look for XBRL tags related to the gain on sale of assets or change in control. The relevant tags are:

- `us-gaap:GainOnSaleOfAssets`
- `us-gaap:GainOnChangeInControl`

However, the sentence mentions the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the equity interest, which is more related to the valuation of the equity interest rather than the gain on sale. Therefore, I will look for tags related to the valuation of equity.

- `us-gaap:CarryingValue`
- `us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementEquity`

**Step 3: Match the numerals with the corresponding XBRL tags**

Based on the context and the relevant XBRL tags, I will match the numerals with the corresponding tags:

- $128.7 million: `us-gaap:CarryingValue` (carrying value of the equity interest)
- $157.6 million: `us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementEquity` (fair value of the equity interest)

However, the sentence also mentions the gain on change in control, which is the difference between the carrying value and the fair value. Therefore, I will also consider the tag `us-gaap:GainOnChangeInControl`.

- $29.0 million: `us-gaap:GainOnChangeInControl` (gain on change in control)

1. Identify the context of the sentence: The sentence is discussing the increase (decrease) to pretax income of the Company's adjustment for nonperformance risk on the fair value of its embedded derivatives.

2. Identify the XBRL tags related to the context:
   - The context is related to the financial statement line item ""pretax income"" and the adjustment for nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives.
   - The XBRL tag for ""pretax income"" is ""us-gaap:IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesContinuingOperations"".
   - The XBRL tag for ""nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives"" is not a standard XBRL tag, but it can be associated with ""us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementEquitySecurities"" or ""us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementDerivativeLiabilities"" depending on the type of embedded derivatives.

3. Identify the XBRL tags for the given numerals:
   - The first numeral, $196 million, is associated with the increase in pretax income due to the adjustment for nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives.
   - The second numeral, $(190) million, is associated with the decrease in pretax income due to the adjustment for nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives.
   - The third numeral, $281 million, is also associated with the increase in pretax income due to the adjustment for nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives.

4. Based on the context and the XBRL tags, the corresponding XBRL tags for the given numerals are:
   - $196 million: ""us-gaap:IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesContinuingOperations""
   - $(190) million: ""us-gaap:IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesContinuingOperations""
   - $281 million: ""us-gaap:IncomeBeforeIncomeTaxesContinuingOperations""

However, since the adjustment for nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives is a specific item, it would be more accurate to use a more specific XBRL tag. In this case, I will use ""us-gaap:FairValueMeasurementEquitySecurities"" as the XBRL tag for the numerals.

5. The final output is:

"Marketable equity securities totaled $1.3 billion as of December31, 2019.",[1.3],"PayPal Holdings, Inc.",10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate the numeral with its corresponding XBRL tag, I will follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.**

The sentence is: ""Marketable equity securities totaled $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2019.""

The numeral is: $1.3 billion

The context is: Marketable equity securities, which is related to the company's investments or assets.

2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag: Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to non-operating income or expense. In this case, it seems to be a distribution to non-controlling interest holders, which is a non-operating activity.

3. Map the numerals to the corresponding XBRL tags:

   - The XBRL tag for a distribution to non-controlling interest holders is ""us-gaap:DistributionToNoncontrollingInterestInEarnings"".

4. The XBRL tag for a per-unit distribution is not a standard tag, but it can be represented as a ""us-gaap:PerUnitDistribution"" or a custom tag.

**Step 1: Identify the context of the numeral**

The sentence is: ""As of December 31, 2020, the carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled $232 million.""

The numeral is: 232.0

The context is: The carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements.

1. Identify the context of the numeral in the sentence.
2. Determine the relevant XBRL tag based on the context.
3. Map the numeral to the corresponding XBRL tag.

From the input sentence: ""During 2019, 1,500 non-employee director options exercised for net proceeds of less than $0.2 million.""

1. The numeral ""0.2"" is associated with the context of ""net proceeds of less than $0.2 million,"" which indicates a financial transaction related to the exercise of non-employee director options.
2. Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag is likely related to ""Proceeds from the exercise of stock options"" or ""Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options.""
3. The XBRL tag for ""Proceeds from the exercise of stock options"" is ""us-gaap:ProceedsFromExerciseOfStockOptions.""

However, since the context specifies ""non-employee director options,"" we need to consider a more specific tag. The XBRL tag for ""Proceeds from the exercise of non-employee director stock options"" is not a standard tag, but we can use a more general tag that is related to non-employee director compensation.

A suitable XBRL tag for non-employee director compensation is ""us-gaap:NonEmployeeCompensation.""

This adjustment resulted in a decrease of net earnings available to Whirlpool of $34 million and a decrease of $0.53 in diluted earnings per share.,[0.53],WHIRLPOOL CORP /DE/,10-K,"To analyze the sentence and associate each numeral with its corresponding financial XBRL tag, I'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the context of the sentence.
2. Determine the type of financial information being discussed.
3. Map the numerals to their corresponding XBRL tags based on the context.

**Sentence Analysis:**
This adjustment resulted in a decrease of net earnings available to Whirlpool of $34 million and a decrease of $0.53 in diluted earnings per share.

**Context:** The sentence discusses a decrease in net earnings and diluted earnings per share.

**Type of Financial Information:**
- Net earnings available to Whirlpool: This is a type of income statement item.
- Diluted earnings per share: This is a type of income statement item related to earnings per share.

**XBRL Tags:**

- For net earnings available to Whirlpool: The XBRL tag for net earnings is ""us-gaap:NetEarningsAvailableForCommonStockholders.""
- For diluted earnings per share: The XBRL tag for diluted earnings per share is ""us-gaap:BasicEarningsPerShare"" and ""us-gaap:DilutedEarningsPerShare.""

However, since the question asks for the decrease in diluted earnings per share, we need to find the XBRL tag for the decrease in earnings per share. The decrease in earnings per share is related to the ""us-gaap:DecreaseInEarningsPerShare"" tag.

However, the sentence mentions ""performance- and non-performance-based stock option awards with respect to 5,001,814 Telenet shares."" This implies that the numeral 5,001,814 is related to the number of shares, not the expense amount. Therefore, I will not associate the numeral 5,001,814 with the XBRL tag.

1. Identify the context of the sentence.
2. Determine the type of expense or transaction being described.

**Sentence Analysis:**
The sentence states that the Company recorded penalties of $0.3 million during fiscal year 2021. It also mentions that penalties recorded during fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were not significant.

**Context:**
The context is related to penalties incurred by the Company.

**XBRL Tag Identification:**
Based on the context, the XBRL tag for penalties is likely related to ""us-gaap:LossContingencies"" or ""us-gaap:LossContingenciesFromLitigation"".

1. Identify the context of the sentence to determine the relevant XBRL tag.
2. Use my knowledge of financial XBRL tags to match the numerals with the corresponding tags.

**Sentence Analysis:**
The sentence mentions ""Capitalized commission costs"" which are recorded in other assets. This suggests that the costs are related to the company's assets, specifically other assets. 

**XBRL Tag Identification:**
Based on the context, the relevant XBRL tag for the capitalized commission costs is likely related to ""Other Assets"" or ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net"" since capitalized costs are typically recorded as assets.

**XBRL Tag Mapping:**
The XBRL tag for ""Other Assets"" is ""us-gaap:OtherAssets"". However, since the costs are capitalized, it's more likely that the tag is related to ""Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net"" which is ""us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentNet"".

**Numerical Association:**
The numerals in the sentence are $38.6 million and $33.7 million, which represent the capitalized commission costs at two different points in time.

**XBRL Tag Association:**
