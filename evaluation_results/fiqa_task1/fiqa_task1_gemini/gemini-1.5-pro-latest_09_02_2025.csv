**Rationale:**

The sentence states that Dixons Carphone is *supporting* the FTSE, implying a positive influence. ""Steadies"" suggests a stabilizing, positive effect, further reinforcing the positive contribution of Dixons Carphone.  While the sentence doesn't express exuberant positivity (which might warrant a score closer to 1), the supportive role clearly indicates positive sentiment.

**Sentiment Score:** -0.250

**Rationale:**

While the sentence mentions ""speeding up strategic change,"" which could be interpreted positively, the dominant action is the Chairman *axing* the CEO.  This forceful action generally signals instability and potential dissatisfaction with current performance, hence the slightly negative sentiment.  It suggests that the current trajectory is not ideal in the eyes of leadership.

Sentiment Score: **-0.750**

Rationale:

The sentence describes a large outflow of assets (34 billion euros) *from* AXA's fund arm.  This signifies a loss of business for AXA and likely reflects negatively on investor confidence in their fund management. While the sentence itself is factual and doesn't contain explicitly negative language, the action described (withdrawal of assets) carries a strong implicit negative sentiment for AXA.  The ""REFILE"" tag doesn't change the underlying sentiment.

Sentence: AB InBev ups offer for SABMiller as deadline looms. Snippets: AB InBev ups offer for SABMiller as deadline looms. Target aspect: SAB Miller,"**Target Aspect:** SABMiller

**Sentiment Score:** 0.300

**Rationale:**

The sentence describes AB InBev increasing its offer for SABMiller.  While the impending deadline adds a sense of urgency and perhaps slight pressure for SABMiller, the primary action—an increased offer—is positive for SABMiller.

The sentence ""HSBC appoints business leaders to its board"" generally carries a positive sentiment.  Appointing business leaders suggests a focus on strengthening leadership, strategic expertise, and potentially improving corporate governance.  These are generally viewed positively by investors and the market.  It doesn't guarantee success, so it's not a maximum positive score (1.0), but it signifies a proactive and potentially beneficial move, hence the 0.5 score.

The sentence describes a product recall.

**Rationale:**

The phrase ""bounces off support"" in a financial context refers to a stock price finding a level where buying pressure overcomes selling pressure, preventing further decline. This is generally considered a mildly positive sign. While it doesn't indicate a strong upward trend, it suggests a temporary stabilization or potential for a reversal.

**Rationale:**

The phrase ""gone green"" in a financial context typically refers to a stock price increasing in value.  Therefore, the sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards Facebook's stock performance on that particular day.  While ""gone green"" doesn't convey exuberant positivity (like ""soared"" or ""skyrocketed"" might), it's clearly positive rather than neutral or negative.  A score of 0.5 reflects this moderate positive sentiment.

The sentence ""$GOOGL is setting up above its 50-day moving average"" is generally considered a positive signal in technical analysis.

Sentiment Score: -0.500

Rationale:

The sentence poses a question about declining user engagement for Facebook.  While it doesn't explicitly state that engagement *is* falling, the very act of raising the question implies concern and a potential negative trend.  Therefore, the sentiment towards Facebook is negative, though not extremely so, as it remains just a question.  A score of -0.500 reflects this moderate negativity and uncertainty.
