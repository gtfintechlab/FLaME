The trend productivity growth rate is growing gradually slower than the economy can grow due to a number of reasons. Therefore, monetary policy-makers should be mindful of the need to carefully monitor trend productivity growth in making their decisions on monetary policy.
DOVISH
The growth in the labor force is expected to be faster than the trend productivity growth rate due to increasing number of people entering the workforce.

NEUTRAL
The trend productivity growth rate is expected to be fairly predictable relative to past growth rates. Therefore, the monetary policy stance should be fairly neutral based on this information.

Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.

This description indicates that the FOMC is expected to increase the interest rates at their meeting in May 2021, as compared to their previous meeting in March 2021.

The rationale for this change in monetary policy is that the US economy is growing rapidly and there are risks of an overheating. The unemployment rate is low, wages are growing at a moderate pace, and inflation is projected to reach the FOMC's 2% inflation target over the coming years. However, the FOMC remains concerned about the persistence of large foreign exchange rates volatility and its negative effect on US exporters. Also, the housing market continues to suffer from tight inventories and rising prices, which could lead to further increases in interest rates if the situation remains unchanged.

The rise in the policy rates was prompted by the increase in the US economic growth and the inflation that resulted from the increase in wage rates.

The stance 'HAWKISH' corresponds to tightening of the monetary policy. The explanation is that the FOMC's sentence 'Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out' indicates that the committee is likely to tighten monetary policy in the future.

0,The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.,"HAWKISH: The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.
The economy shifted from strong growth in the first half of 2019 to slower growth in the second half of 2019. The main drag came from higher taxes and other economic interventions implemented to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.Businesses became more cautious in their spending plans. This was reflected in slower growth in real GDP, increasing deficit, and declining corporate profits. The projected GDP deficit for the 2021 fiscal year, published in the FOMC’s Surveys of Consumers in February, declined by 20 percent compared to the previous year. The recovery is likely to be bumpy and could entail more economic volatility in the near term. While many survey participants projected more dovishness in monetary policy, the hawks were clearly in the majority. The unemployment rate is highly volatile and appears to be stabilizing at around its full employment level. The gradual adjustment in economic policies and monetary policy accommodations will support a return to 2 percent inflation. The Fed is likely to keep the short-term interest rates lower for some time.
