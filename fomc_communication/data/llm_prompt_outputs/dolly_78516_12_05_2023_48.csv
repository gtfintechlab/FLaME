Economic activity in China has been impacted by COVID-19 more than most other countries, and the approach of the Chinese government to the pandemic thus remains an upside risk for inflation.

Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle. Fiscal and monetary policy in most economies can have a neutral or conflicting impact on these two measures. For example, fiscal tightening can lower economic activity and inflation by diminishing the aggregate demand. In contrast, monetary policy typically aims to maintain stable prices by increasing the supply of money and, thus, decreasing the effective demand. Therefore, tight fiscal policy and monetary policy can, in principle, lead to a reduction in the pace of economic activity and increase the probability of a fiscal cliff.

The economic data continue to show a weak and uneven recovery with the COVID-19-induced shockwaves showing some signs of subsiding. Nevertheless, the unemployment rate remains elevated, financial stability remains precarious for some financial institutions and key industries, and real household net worth remains well below its long-term average. In addition, the subdued pace of economic growth and heightened financial stability risks have prompted the Committee to make considerable progress in easing. The economy is struggling with the ongoing health pandemic, which has wreaked havoc on the real economy. The Committee estimates that a smoother and more gradual improvement in the economic outlook, if realized, should increase confidence and further strengthen the economy.

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) agreed that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace and labor market conditions have improved significantly over recent months, especially given the amount of time it has taken the labor market to heal following the 2007-09 crisis.

The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.
It is expected that thepath of policy rates will likely be需 to move mildly upward over the intermeeting period. 
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that, although the economic dynamics have improved somewhat since the previous meeting, sustained inflation has remained modest. Headline inflation has risen over the past month, and although longer-term inflation expectations have improved somewhat since the previous meeting, the sustained inflation forecast called for in the February Inflation Report is roughly similar to that of the previous report. 
Headline inflation has increased partly due to changes in some prices, such as for services, and partly due to deflation of raw materials prices. Nevertheless, survey-based measures of cost of living increases are generally little changed over the past several months. 
Committee members generally agree that the near-term inflation outlook could well stray below the Committee’s 2 percent objective over the near term, especially if economic growth picks up more quickly than expected.

explanation:
The FOMC members generally expected moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term, although most participants noted that a significant slowdown was unlikely.

Most participants noted that near-term economic uncertainties, including various downside risks to the global economic forecast, would likely produce modest offsets to the generally positive prospects for the near term. Participants generally expected a moderately upbeat demand forecast, although some noted that downside risks could shift expectations down modestly.
Following its December 2018 meeting, the FOMC tempered expectations for further monetary policy tightening. In the March 2020 HPS, a growing number of participants were projected to shift the balance of policy opinion towards somewhat more dovish guidance. Participants cited a combination of factors in support of a dovish revision, including: more gradual economic growth than anticipated at the December 2018 meeting, muted projected progress towards inflation dynamics that would achieve"
