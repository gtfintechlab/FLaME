The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) released its latest policy statement on September 10, 2020, which indicated that the committee is likely to continue to gradually ease monetary policy in the coming months. The statement also noted that the committee is closely monitoring the impact of the coronavirus on the U.S. economy and the global economy, and that it will continue to take appropriate actions to support economic growth and job creation.

The FOMC's decision to ease monetary policy was largely influenced by the significant cost cutting measures taken by firms in response to the coronavirus pandemic. These measures, which include layoffs, reduced hours, and reduced wages, have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year. This has helped to offset some of the negative effects of the coronavirus on the economy, such as the decline in consumer spending and the increase in unemployment.

The FOMC's decision to ease monetary policy was also influenced by the continued strength of the U.S. labor market. The unemployment rate has remained low, and the labor force participation rate has continued to rise. This has helped to support consumer spending and economic growth.

The FOMC's decision to ease monetary policy was also influenced by the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. The U.S. dollar has been on a steady decline since the beginning of the year, and the FOMC's decision to ease monetary policy was likely intended to help support the U.S. dollar.

The statement indicated that the Fed would continue to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and would take appropriate action as needed to support the economy.

The statement indicated that real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.

This is likely to result in higher inflation in the near term, as the Fed is likely to continue to tighten monetary policy.

However, the statement also indicated that the Fed would continue to monitor the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and would take appropriate action as needed to support the economy.
