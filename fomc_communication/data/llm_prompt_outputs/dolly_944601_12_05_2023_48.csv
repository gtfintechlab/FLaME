However, I am a machine, not a human, so I can sure teach a machine to do this! I will use a deep neural network with large amounts of data to be able to better detect these signals and categories.

The model will learn to detect these categories automatically from large amounts of data. The model can look at the text and'see' if the inflation is high or low"

Spanish bank BBVA has developed a system to evaluate the toxicity of words, using multiple external data sources, such as Google Trends and Twitter. The aim of this publication is to make the tool available to the WIDEN research community and to share the ideas and insights around the topic of toxicity.

BBVA worked with five big international Spanish law firms in order to build the toxic word dictionary, through an open and inclusive crowdsourcing process, providing the opportunity to the wider research community to contribute. The development of the toxic word dictionary was made publicly available on GitHub with a license that permits commercial and non-commercial use.

The dictionary includes over 7,000 toxic words, grouped into 18 categories (e.g. racial or derogatory terms, government terms, criminal terms, etc.) and associated to a toxicity score (0-100). The toxicity score is calculated considering several aspects related to the offensiveness, con"

The committee does not see significant increase in either factors. This should allow for a gradual but predictable increase in interest rates.

""Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so.""
 explanation
The FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so. In other words, while most participants projected stronger GDP growth in the near future, the Chairperson, Lael Brainard, expressed concerns that such projections might be too confident and could prove to be wrong, leading to unstable inflation dynamics.
""preemptive tightening"" implies the FOMC was afraid of causing inflation even without an emergent threat. This contradicts the ""recognizing uncertainties"" part of the explanation. The Chairperson was not uncertain about the inflationary threat. She was just being cautious, i.e. She was not eager to tighten monetary policy in the face of an emergent threat."

Dear Misspeller,
Sorry, I can't vote for this. Against this background, the sentence does not contain any information related to monetary policy. The FOMC doesn't even exist yet at this point. This is the first meeting of FOMC. So the sentence doesn't indicate either tightening or easing of monetary policy.

The stance is neutral
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) today decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. As the economic analysis suggested that inflation is expected to over time reach the Committee’s 2 percent objective, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.
In the statement, the Committee indicated that “inflation has run below 2 percent since mid-2014 in part due to declines in commodity prices and in imports, and that inflation, while highly variable, remains low by historical standards”.
The Committee judges that “aligning the stance of monetary policy with the evolution of the economic situation remains the appropriate course at this time”.
However, the statement indicates that “economic growth and the labor market have shown considerable improvement this year, and even though uncertainties remain, the increasing optimism appears to us to be substantial enough to expect further improvement in the near future”.
In our view, the statement indicates that the FOMC is “hawkish” since the target range for the federal funds rate was increased despite the fact that inflation is expected to over time reach the FOMC’s 2 percent objective"

HAWKISH: 'overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection'

1,wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.,"HAWKISH
The price increase is hawkish, since it is relative to its level a year ago, and 12 months ago it was decreased. Therefore, the monetary policy is being tightened.
DOVISH
The price increase is dovish, since it is absolute, and since it is the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000. Therefore, the monetary policy is being eased.
NEUTRAL
The price increase is neutral, since the absolute value of the increment is not given, and since it is the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000. Therefore, the monetary policy is being kept unchanged."

NEUTRAL
So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.
Explanation: The current conditions, including low interest rates and low house prices, makes it possible for those who can get credit to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago. It is therefore likely that the FOMC will tighten monetary policy in the future."
2,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent,","HAWKISH
Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent. Thus, despite the considerable economic expansion, there is little risk of inflation running too hot for too long. An immediate tightening would likely be needed, even for theeconomy to pace out the unique transitory shocks. A more comprehensive assessment, however, would take into account how headline inflation has already come considerably closer to target than was the case in most advanced countries just a few years ago.
Additionally, the balance of risks has shifted slightly in favor of more gradual policy normalisation, although a tightening bias remains appropriate given historical performance. In particular, the degree of financial stability risk has diminished, as measures of marginal-risk-adjusted unemployment are at or near low levels. Moreover, growth abroad and lurking inflation at home seem likely to keep a tightening bias in place.
DOVISH
Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent. Thus, despite the considerable economic expansion, there is little risk of inflation running too hot for too long. An immediate easing would likely be needed, even for the economy to ease too sharply or for inflation to overshoot.

So, this sentence needs to be classified as 'HAWKISH'. The statement 'If we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect, my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.' indicates that the speaker is worried about too much monetary tightening. This is because, according to the consensus forecasts, the FOMC is expected to keep the interest rates very low for a long time. Therefore, the sentence needs to be classified as 'HAWKISH'."

This report indicates that inflation is likely to remain low over the near term.

DOVISH
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sought to normalize monetary policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/4% to 1/2%2.

The FOMC met two times in a week and slightly reduced the length of the nominal bond purchasing program (reduction of 100 billion to 50 billion). The committee also left the unemployment rate target range of 5.5% to 6.5%1.

In addition, the FOMC expressed confidence in the evolution of the economy, without specifying any quantitative target.

These measures, along with temporary factors that are impacting inflation, should allow the case for gradual rate hikes to evolve over the near term.

This report indicates that inflation is likely to remain low over the near term.

Explanation: The FOMC statement implies that the hawksish economists (the authors of the statement) expect the energy prices to increase due to Hurricane Laura's impacts on oil supply chain. The increased energy prices would have negative effects on the real disposable income and spending demands of households. Therefore, the hawksish economists expect the negative effects of higher energy prices on the household sector to partially offset the positive effects of higher incomes due to lower interest rates.
DOVISH: The effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector would not account for in the March 2023 FOMC statement.

significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year
explanation: The FOMC meeting in March led many market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve would tighten monetary policy in 2019. In fact, the Fed categorized its published minutes from the March FOMC meeting as hawkish, which led many market participants to believe that a hike in interest rates was likely in the summer of 2019. However, the August FOMC meeting disappointed many market participants who were hoping for a more dovish or aggressive stance, and resulted in a large majority of financial markets pricing in only a 25% chance of a 50bp rate hike at the December FOMC meeting. The June 2019 edition of the “Beige Book” notes that “sizable increases in productivity growth were attributed largely to significant cost cutting,” which many analysts interpreted as a sign that economic growth would likely decelerate in the second half of 2019, rather than accelerating as many had previously expected.

NEUTRAL
 labeled as HAWKISH
Moving away from conventional narratives about the evolution of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)’s policy stance, accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting. Higher output per hour of work means that it takes fewer workers to produce the same amount of output. This means that economic models that assume productivity growth follows a natural trend may be inadequate.
The FOMC—the Federal Reserve’s committee responsible for setting interest rates—tightened monetary policy last week, bringing the future of interest rates further into uncertainty. The change in the federal funds rate remains very low—less than 1 percent—but the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to raise interest rates in part because of headwinds to growth and inflation. This rate increase is the fourth in just over a year, and some market participants believe the FOMC is tightening too rapidly.
Moving away from conventional narratives about the FOMC’s policy stance, higher productivity means that the committee may need to re-evaluate its assumptions about growth and inflation.

Explanation: The FOMC met in March 2020 and expanded theirquantitative easing program by purchasing Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities. These actions are dovish since the economy is weak and the policy expectation is for more economic stabilization by buying bonds and securities. 

In contrast, productivity’s been very low suggests that the current monetary policy is not adequate to increase the economy out of the slump. The low productivity indicates that the economy is not functioning at its full capacity. Therefore, the FOMC’s action of quantitative easing may be 'hawkish', i.e., the monetary policy is getting tight."

The expectation of a 25bps rate increase in 2020 (vs. 15bps in 2019) was largely driven by the escalating risks from the COVID-19 outbreak, which was seen as impacting both consumer and business spending, as well as the global economy as a whole. The Fed's gradualist stance on rate hikes was also a concern for the markets, as some participants wanted the committee to signal a more ""hawkish"" stance, i.e. a more aggressive path of rate hikes.
