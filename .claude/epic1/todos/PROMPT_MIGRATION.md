# Prompt System Migration Plan

## Current Status

The prompt migration is complete! 

- All prompt functions have been migrated to the new package structure under `src/flame/code/prompts/`
- All imports across the codebase have been updated to use the new structure
- The legacy files have been removed (prompts_zeroshot.py and prompts_fewshot.py)
- prompt_registry.py now forwards to the new registry implementation
- Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory

The new structure provides:

1. A registry-based system for accessing prompts via task name and format
2. Clear separation of concerns with different prompt formats in separate modules
3. Proper documentation and type annotations
4. Constants moved to a dedicated module for better organization

## Migration Process Summary

The migration was completed in the following phases:

### Phase 1: Package Structure Creation

1. Created the new package structure under `src/flame/code/prompts/`
2. Implemented the registry system with `PromptFormat` enum and decorator
3. Set up backward compatibility for the original prompt modules

### Phase 2: Zero-Shot Prompt Migration

1. Migrated all zero-shot prompts to `flame/code/prompts/zeroshot.py`
2. Added proper docstrings and type annotations
3. Updated `__init__.py` to expose these prompts
4. Created backward compatibility in `prompts_zeroshot.py`

### Phase 3: Import Path Updates for Zero-Shot Prompts

1. Identified 20 modules importing directly from `prompts_zeroshot.py`
2. Updated all modules to import from the new structure
3. Verified that all tests pass with the new imports

### Phase 4: Few-Shot Prompt Migration

1. Migrated all few-shot prompts to `flame/code/prompts/fewshot.py`
2. Added proper docstrings and type annotations
3. Updated `__init__.py` to expose these prompts
4. Created backward compatibility in `prompts_fewshot.py`

### Phase 5: Import Path Updates for Few-Shot Prompts

1. Identified 16 modules importing directly from `prompts_fewshot.py`
2. Updated all modules to import from the new structure
3. Verified that all tests pass with the new imports

### Phase 6: Documentation

1. Created comprehensive documentation for the new prompt system
2. Added examples and best practices
3. Documented the registry system and extension patterns

### Phase 7: Cleanup

1. Moved constants to a dedicated `constants.py` file
2. Updated `prompt_registry.py` to forward to the new implementation
3. Removed deprecated prompt files
4. Updated tests to work with the new structure

## Benefits of New Structure

The new package structure provides several benefits:

1. **Centralized registry**: Single point for finding and accessing all prompts
2. **Better organization**: Clean separation of prompt types and tasks
3. **Documentation**: Improved documentation with proper docstrings and type annotations
4. **Discoverability**: Functions can be accessed via the registry or direct imports
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new prompt formats or variants
6. **Testing**: Better testability with clear boundaries and isolated components
7. **Maintainability**: Constants and common code are shared across modules

## Next Steps

While we've successfully migrated all prompt functionality, there are still a couple of areas that could be improved in future work:

1. **Fix test failures**: Some evaluation and inference tests are currently failing. These failures are unrelated to the prompt migration itself but should be addressed in a future PR.

2. **Complete prompt_registry.py removal**: While `prompt_registry.py` now forwards to the new implementation, it could eventually be completely removed to simplify the codebase further.
