                Sentiment Analysis using Python and NLTK
                This tutorial shows how to use Python and NLTK for sentiment analysis. We will analyze some
                tweets to determine whether they express positive, negative or neutral sentiments. We will
                also compare two different approaches for sentiment classification using machine learning.
                In this tutorial we will be using Python 3.6 with the NLTK library installed.
                Python has become very popular for data science tasks because of its powerful data structures
                (like dictionaries) and its simple syntax. In addition, Python has many libraries that make
