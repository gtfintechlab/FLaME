      "Predicted Relation: Based on the given sentence, the relationship between PeopleSoft and JD Edwards can be classified as \"subsidiary\" because Rimini Street provides support for both products, which suggests that they are part of the same company or group of companies. In this case, since both entities are mentioned as separate from Oracle Corporation, it can be inferred that they are subsidiaries of Oracle Corporation.\n",
