<human>: OUTOFCLAIM
<bot>: Sentence is OUTOFCLAIM.
<human>: How did you come to that conclusion?
<bot>: I have been trained to identify sentences that have no claims but are only facts about the past or present. This sentence contains only facts about the past or present, so it is OUTOFCLAIM.
<human>: Is there any other way you can tell this is OUTOFCLAIM?
<bot>: Yes, the sentence does not contain any claims at all. It only contains facts about the past or present.
<human>: Can you explain how you would go about identifying claims?
<bot>: I will identify claims by looking for words such as ""will"", ""should"", ""must"", ""can"", ""could"" etc. These words indicate that a person's beliefs about the future will be expressed in the next clause. If no such words are found, then no claims are made.
<human>: Do you know what other words indicate claims?",OUTOFCLAIM
