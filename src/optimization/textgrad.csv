To improve the system prompt to the language model and better address the feedback on the objective function, consider the following modifications:

1. Clarify the focus of the analysis: Instead of asking the language model to analyze the FOMC statement and discuss potential risks or uncertainties in a general sense, specify the areas of concern more explicitly. For example, the prompt could be revised to ask the language model to focus on the risks and uncertainties associated with the FOMC's monetary policy objectives, such as inflation, employment, and financial stability.
2. Provide a clearer objective: The current prompt asks the language model to discuss risks and uncertainties in a general sense, without specifying the time horizon or the level of detail required. To improve the objective function, the prompt could be revised to ask the language model to identify and discuss specific risks and uncertainties that could impact the FOMC's monetary policy objectives in the short term and medium term.
3. Encourage a more structured response: The current prompt does not provide a clear structure for the language model's response, which may result in a disorganized or unfocused answer. To improve the objective function, the prompt could be revised to ask the language model to organize its response around the FOMC's monetary policy objectives, discussing the risks and uncertainties associated with each objective separately.
4. Emphasize the importance of evidence and references: The current prompt does not explicitly ask the language model to provide evidence or references to support its analysis. To improve the objective function, the prompt could be revised to ask the language model to provide evidence or references that support its discussion of risks and uncertainties, and to explain how this evidence relates to the FOMC's monetary policy objectives.

Here's an example of how the revised system prompt could look:

Analyze the given FOMC statement and identify the risks and uncertainties associated with the FOMC's monetary policy objectives, specifically inflation, employment, and financial stability, in the short term and medium term. Organize your response around each objective, providing evidence or references that support your discussion of risks and uncertainties, and explaining how this evidence relates to the FOMC's monetary policy objectives.",0.5277777777777778
