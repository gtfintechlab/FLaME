US-GAAP stands for United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which is the accounting standard used in the US.\n\nSo, I need to be familiar with common US-GAAP terms and their corresponding XBRL tags. For example, revenue might be tagged as ""us-gaap:Revenue"", and some expense could be ""us-gaap:SomeExpense"". The ""other"" category is for numbers that don\'t fit into standard US-GAAP categories.\n\nNow, let\'s look at the sentence', role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None, provider_specific_fields={'refusal': None}, refusal=None))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=256, prompt_tokens=164, total_tokens=420, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), service_tier=None, prompt=[])"

The sentence is: ""Total lease cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $7.3 million.""

First, I need to identify all the numerals in this sentence. Let's break it down:

1. ""December 31, 2019"" – Here, ""31"" is the day, and ""2019"" is the year.

2. ""$7.3 million"" – This is a monetary value, specifically a dollar amount.

So, the numerals are:

- 31

- 2019

- 7.3

Now, I need to assign the most appropriate US-GAAP XBRL tag to each of these numerals based on their context in the sentence.
