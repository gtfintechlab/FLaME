"The December 2013 Program resulted in the elimination of approximately 1,100 positions in 2014, primarily in China.",[],"Revlon, Inc.",10-K,"Based on the provided sentence and the context given, the numeral ""1,100"" refers to the number of positions that were eliminated as a result of the December 2013 Program. The most accurate XBRL tag for this numeral would be related to employee termination benefits or restructuring charges, as these are common tags used when reporting the costs associated with eliminating positions.

Given that the sentence does not explicitly state the financial impact in monetary terms, but rather in terms of positions eliminated, we would typically not tag the number ""1,100"" directly with an XBRL financial element. However, if we were to infer the financial impact, it would likely be associated with costs such as severance pay, benefits continuation, or other termination benefits.

If the sentence did provide the financial impact of these position eliminations, we would use a tag such as:

- `us-gaap:EmployeeTerminationBenefits` for the costs associated with the termination of employees, or
- `us-gaap:RestructuringCharges` if the costs were part of a broader restructuring plan.

Since the sentence does not provide a monetary value, there is no numeral to tag directly. However, if we were to assume that the company disclosed the monetary impact elsewhere in the document, the tags mentioned above would be appropriate.

"The net pension liability of $21.5 million and $37.0 million was included in long-term accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of May31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.","[21.5, 37.0]",Cintas Corp,10-K,"Based on the provided sentence and the context of the financial numerals, the most accurate XBRL tags for the numerals would be as follows:

```json
{
  ""21.5"": ""us-gaap:NetPensionLiabilityCurrent"",
  ""37.0"": ""us-gaap:NetPensionLiabilityNoncurrent""
}
```

Explanation:
- The term ""net pension liability"" refers to the amount by which the pension obligation exceeds the pension plan assets. This is a specific type of liability related to pension plans.
- The phrase ""was included in long-term accrued liabilities"" indicates that this liability is considered noncurrent since it is part of long-term liabilities.
- The balance sheet categorizes liabilities as either current (due within one year) or noncurrent (due after one year). Since the net pension liability is included in long-term accrued liabilities, it is tagged as noncurrent for the previous year (2020).
- However, the sentence does not explicitly state that the entire $21.5 million is current or noncurrent as of May 31, 2021. In practice, the classification between current and noncurrent would depend on the expected timing of the related pension payments. Without additional context suggesting that the entire amount is current, it is reasonable to assume that the $21.5 million includes both current and noncurrent components as of the balance sheet date. Therefore, I have tagged it as ""us-gaap:NetPensionLiabilityCurrent"" under the assumption that the current portion is being referenced, which is common in balance sheet discussions. If the entire amount were noncurrent, both amounts would be tagged with ""us-gaap:NetPensionLiabilityNoncurrent"".

Please note that the exact tagging can vary depending on the specific accounting policies of the company and additional context in the financial statements. If there is more detailed information provided elsewhere in the 10-K that specifies the current and noncurrent split of the net pension liability as of May 31, 2021, the tags should be adjusted accordingly.","[21.5, 37.0]","ModelResponse(id='8f19761188f48417-YVR', created=1734129682, model='together_ai/microsoft/WizardLM-2-8x22B', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, choices=[Choices(finish_reason='stop', index=0, message=Message(content=' Based on the provided sentence and the context of the financial numerals, the most accurate XBRL tags for the numerals would be as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  ""21.5"": ""us-gaap:NetPensionLiabilityCurrent"",\n  ""37.0"": ""us-gaap:NetPensionLiabilityNoncurrent""\n}\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The term ""net pension liability"" refers to the amount by which the pension obligation exceeds the pension plan assets.

The use of an effective interest rate to determine the fair value of the liability component suggests that this allocation is part of the accounting for a financial instrument, likely a debt instrument with an equity component, such as a convertible note.

Given this context, the most accurate XBRL tag for the numeral $701.9 million would be ""us-gaap:DebtIssuanceCosts"".

Since the sentence does not explicitly state that the $701.9 million is a cost, but rather an allocation to the equity component, and assuming that the equity component is not being recognized as a separate financial instrument (which might otherwise be tagged with an equity issuance cost tag), the tag ""us-gaap:Equity"" could be considered for the equity component.

The sentence discusses the impact on pretax income due to adjustments for nonperformance risk on the fair value of embedded derivatives, which is a financial component of the company's financial instruments. The adjustments are net of deferred acquisition costs (DAC), deferred sales inducement costs (DSIC), unearned revenue amortization, and the reinsurance accrual.

Given this context, the most accurate XBRL tags for these numerals would likely be related to the changes in the fair value of financial instruments, specifically those related to embedded derivatives and the associated adjustments. The XBRL tags that seem most appropriate are:

- `us-gaap:GainsLossesOnDerivativesNotDesignatedAsHedges`
- `us-gaap:UnrealizedGainLossOnDerivativeInstrumentsMarketToMarket`

However, since the numerals are specifically related to nonperformance risk adjustments and are net of certain costs, we need to find a tag that reflects this specificity. The tag `us-gaap:GainsLossesOnDerivativesNotDesignatedAsHedges` might be the most appropriate if the embedded derivatives are not designated as hedging instruments. If they are part of a hedging relationship, then `us-gaap:GainsLossesOnDerivativeInstrumentsDesignatedAsHedgesNetOfTax` would be more appropriate.

- `us-gaap:InvestmentsAvailableForSale` for investments that are not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading securities.

However, since the sentence does not specify the exact nature of the investments (whether they are held-to-maturity or available for sale), and considering that both categories are mentioned, it would be appropriate to use both tags for each numeral to cover the possibility that the total amount includes both types of investments.

Here is the JSON output with the associated XBRL tags:

Given that the adjustment is to expense, and considering the context of mortgage banking fees, the appropriate tag could be:

- `us-gaap:GainsLossesOnDerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivities` if the fair value adjustment is related to derivatives or hedging activities.
- `us-gaap:GainsLossesOnFinancialInstrumentsNotHeldToMaturity` if the adjustment is related to financial instruments that are not held to maturity.
- `us-gaap:MortgageBankingIncome` if the adjustment directly affects the mortgage banking income line.

"At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of derivatives included in trading assets is net of $2,763 million and $2,538 million, respectively, relating to amounts recognized for the obligation to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties.",[],HSBC USA Inc.,10-K,"Based on the provided sentence and the context given, the financial numerals $2,763 million and $2,538 million are related to the fair value of derivatives included in trading assets, net of the amounts recognized for the obligation to return cash collateral received under master netting agreements with derivative counterparties. This suggests that these numerals are associated with the valuation of financial instruments and the related liabilities.

Given this context, the most accurate XBRL tags for these numerals would likely be related to the fair value of financial instruments and liabilities. The appropriate tags could be:

- `us-gaap:FairValueOfDerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivitiesCurrent` for the current year fair value of derivatives.
- `us-gaap:FairValueOfDerivativeInstrumentsAndHedgingActivitiesNoncurrent` for the noncurrent year fair value of derivatives, if the amounts are related to noncurrent assets or liabilities.
- `us-gaap:LiabilitiesAssociatedWithDerivativesAndHedgingActivitiesCurrent` for the current liability portion related to the obligation to return cash collateral.
- `us-gaap:LiabilitiesAssociatedWithDerivativesAndHedgingActivitiesNoncurrent` for the noncurrent liability portion related to the obligation to return cash collateral, if applicable.

However, since the sentence does not explicitly state whether these amounts are current or noncurrent, and considering that the fair value of derivatives can be both an asset and a liability depending on the context, it is important to determine the nature of these amounts from the rest of the financial statements.

The unamortized basis difference is often related to goodwill or other intangible assets that arise from the acquisition of a business.

Given that the sentence does not explicitly state whether these amounts are related to goodwill or another intangible asset, we would need to choose a tag that is broad enough to encompass an unamortized basis difference.

A more appropriate tag might be ""us-gaap:OtherAssetsNet"" if the unamortized basis difference is not related to goodwill or intangible assets, or ""us-gaap:Goodwill"" if it is related to goodwill from acquisitions.

The XBRL tag ""us-gaap:CommonStockSharesOutstanding"" is typically used to represent the number of shares of common stock that are outstanding, but in this context, where the price per share is being discussed, it is more appropriate to use a tag related to the price of the common stock. However, there isn't a direct XBRL tag for the last reported sale price of common stock. Therefore, the closest match would be a tag that represents the value of the common stock, which could be ""us-gaap:CommonStockValue"". If the context specifically requires the tagging of the sale price, then a more specific tag such as ""us-gaap:CommonStockPrice"" would be appropriate, but such a tag does not exist in the standard US GAAP taxonomy. In practice, the price of common stock might not be explicitly tagged in XBRL, or a custom tag could be created if the company's accounting policies require it.

Since the context does not specify the nature of the asset, we will use the more general tag for the loss on disposal.

- For the £29 million ($41 million) loss on consolidation, the tag `us-gaap:LossOnImpairmentOrDisposalOfAssets` would be appropriate, as it reflects the loss recognized due to the impairment or disposal of the loan receivable.

```json
{
  ""14.9"": ""us-gaap:OtherExpenseIncomeNet"",

Explanation:
- The phrase ""resulting in a net benefit of $14.9 million for fiscal 2018"" suggests that this amount is part of the ""Other expense (income), net"" category, as it is characterized as a net benefit.
- Similarly, ""a net cost of $1.4 million for fiscal 2017"" indicates that this amount is also related to ""Other expense (income), net,"" but as a net cost.
- Since both amounts are associated with the same category of ""Other expense (income), net,"" they should be tagged with the same XBRL element, which in this case is ""us-gaap:OtherExpenseIncomeNet.""
- The retrospective application of an accounting standard update (ASU) typically affects the comparative periods presented, which is why both fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are mentioned in the context of the same accounting event.

Please note that the exact XBRL tag can vary depending on the specific nature of the ""Other expense (income), net"" and the detailed financial reporting of SYSCO CORP.

They provide a comprehensive overview of the company's financial performance and health. The XBRL tags used in these reports are based on the US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) taxonomy, which provides a structured way to categorize financial information.

Given the input sentence and the numeral in question, we need to identify the financial concept that best matches the context provided by the sentence. The sentence refers to gross equity derivative receivables and payables, which are financial instruments that can be complex and involve significant risks.

The numeral ""1.6"" is associated with gross equity derivative payables. In the context of derivatives, the appropriate XBRL tag would be one that relates to derivative liabilities, as these payables represent an obligation to pay at a future date.

Based on the US GAAP taxonomy, the most accurate XBRL tag for the numeral ""1.6"" associated with gross equity derivative payables would likely be:

```json

This tag is used for reporting the current portion of derivative liabilities. However, if the payables are long-term in nature, the tag could be:

It's also important to note that the company may have specific presentations in their financial statements that could affect the tagging decision.

Given that the sentence does not specify the nature of the investment (e.g., equity method, cost method, etc.), and considering the context of potential loss, a general tag for investments in non-consolidated entities would be appropriate.

Explanation:
- The numeral $295 million represents income from discontinued operations, which is typically added back to arrive at income from continuing operations before taxes and other adjustments.

Since the sentence does not specify the nature of the reserve, we might use a more general tag such as ""us-gaap:LiabilitiesCurrent"" or ""us-gaap:Liabilities"". However, given that part of the reserve is recorded in Other non-current liabilities, it suggests that a portion of the $151 million is non-current. Therefore, the most appropriate tag might be ""us-gaap:OtherAccruedLiabilitiesNoncurrent"" for the non-current portion.

- For the $99 million recorded in Other accrued liabilities: This is a current liability and should be tagged with ""us-gaap:OtherAccruedLiabilitiesCurrent"".

- For the $52 million recorded in Other non-current liabilities: This is a non-current liability and should be tagged with ""us-gaap:OtherAccruedLiabilitiesNoncurrent"".

Since the sentence specifies that the expenses are related to state and federal income taxes for a taxable REIT subsidiary, we can use the following tags:

- `us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit`: This tag is used to report the income tax expense or benefit for the period. It is a comprehensive tag that includes all types of income tax expenses, including those related to state and federal taxes.

- `us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpenseBenefitFromContinuingOperations`: This tag is more specific and reports the income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations. It is appropriate if the income tax expense is related to the ongoing operations of the taxable REIT subsidiary.

- `us-gaap:CurrentIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit`: This tag is used for the portion of the income tax expense or benefit that is expected to be paid or recovered within one year.

- `us-gaap:DeferredIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit`: This tag is used for the portion of the income tax expense or benefit that is deferred and will affect tax assets or liabilities.

Given that the sentence does not specify whether the taxes are current or deferred, and considering that REITs often have both current and deferred tax components due to their tax structure, it would be appropriate to tag the expenses as `us-gaap:IncomeTaxExpenseBenefit`. However, if the company's disclosure typically separates current and deferred taxes, you might need to allocate the amounts between `us-gaap:CurrentIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit` and `us-gaap:DeferredIncomeTaxExpenseBenefit`.

Explanation:
- The sentence refers to the fair value of public debt, which is a type of long-term debt.
- The terms ""fair value"" and ""public debt"" suggest that this is related to the company's long-term obligations that are traded in the public market.
- The XBRL tag ""us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent"" is appropriate for reporting the carrying amount of long-term debt that is not due currently.
- The fair value of the debt is being reported, which is typically not the same as the carrying amount. However, in the context of XBRL tagging for SEC reporting, the carrying amount is often used as a proxy for fair value when market quotes (Level 1 inputs) are available, unless specifically instructed to use a different tag for fair value measurements.
- The ASC 820 fair value hierarchy level is not directly relevant to the XBRL tag choice for the debt amount itself, but it does inform us about the method of valuation.

Please note that in some cases, there might be a more specific XBRL tag for debt fair value, especially if the company provides a separate disclosure for the fair value of debt. However, based on the information provided and common SEC reporting practices, ""us-gaap:LongTermDebtNoncurrent"" is the most appropriate tag for the numerals given.

Since the sentence does not provide specific numerals, we can assume that the actual figures would be reported elsewhere in the document. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we will consider the tags that would be associated with these types of transactions.

The XBRL tags for gains or losses from marketable securities would typically fall under the category of ""us-gaap:GainsLossesNotAffectingIncome"" if they are unrealized gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income. If the gains or losses are realized and affect net income, they would be tagged with ""us-gaap:GainsLossesOnInvestmentsNetOfTaxes"" or a similar tag that reflects the nature of the investment and whether it is a debt or equity security.

Given that the sentence mentions ""net of tax expense (benefit),"" we can infer that the numerals would reflect the after-tax impact of these activities. Therefore, the most accurate tags for the numerals representing the after-tax gains or losses from marketable security activities would likely be:

- For realized gains or losses affecting net income:

Given that the sentence does not explicitly state the proceeds from the sale of the warrants but does mention the exercise price, we would typically use a tag related to the fair value of warrant liabilities or equity instruments, as the exercise price is a significant attribute of the warrant.

In SEC reporting, these amounts would typically be classified as a form of ""Due to Affiliates"" or ""Due from Affiliates"" depending on whether the company owes or is owed the money. Since the sentence does not specify the direction of the amounts (whether the company owes the joint venture or vice versa), we would need to use the context of the document to determine the correct XBRL tag.

However, given the information provided, we can assume that these amounts are related to transactions with a related party, which is the joint venture in this case. The appropriate XBRL tag for amounts due to or from a related party would typically be under the ""Related Party Transactions"" category.

For the purpose of this task, I will assume that the amounts represent balances due from the joint venture to the company (i.e., the company is owed $1 at the end of 2019 and $2 at the end of 2018). Therefore, the most accurate XBRL tags would be:

- For the amount of $2.0: `us-gaap:DueFromRelatedPartiesCurrent` if it's due within one year, or `us-gaap:DueFromRelatedPartiesNoncurrent` if it's due beyond one year.
