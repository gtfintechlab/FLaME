In XBRL, the tag for impairment charges under US-GAAP is ""us-gaap:ImpairmentLoss"". However, the sentence does not specify the type of asset or liability that was impaired, so a more specific tag like ""us-gaap:ImpairmentLoss-LeaseRights"" or ""us-gaap:ImpairmentLoss-InvestmentProperty"" would be more accurate if that information was available.
