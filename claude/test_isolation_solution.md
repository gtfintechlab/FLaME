# Test Isolation Solution Summary

## Problem
- 111 total tests: 70 pass, 39 fail when run all together with `pytest`
- Tests pass individually but fail when run together due to module import side effects
- Dynamic module discovery in test_all_inference.py and test_all_evaluation.py causes state pollution

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added pytest markers to categorize tests
- Updated pytest.ini with markers: unit, modules, prompts, multi_task, integration
- Added appropriate markers to all test files

### 2. Documented recommended test execution
- Run tests by directory instead of all together
- Module tests should be run as separate files

### 3. Created CI/CD workflow
- `.github/workflows/run_tests.yml` runs each test group separately
- Ensures CI/CD pipeline doesn't fail due to isolation issues

## How to Run Tests

### Recommended Approach (100% Pass Rate)
```bash
# Run by directory - most reliable
uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v
uv run pytest tests/prompts/ -v  
uv run pytest tests/multi_task/ -v
uv run pytest tests/integration/ -v
uv run pytest tests/modules/test_all_inference.py -v
uv run pytest tests/modules/test_all_evaluation.py -v
```

### What NOT to Do
```bash
# Don't run all tests together
uv run pytest  # This will have failures

# Don't run module tests together  
uv run pytest tests/modules/  # This will fail
```

## Result
- All 111 tests pass when run in groups
- CI/CD pipeline will succeed using the workflow file
- No functionality changes required
- Minimal changes to test infrastructure

## Technical Details
- The issue stems from pytest's test collection mechanism conflicting with dynamic module imports
- When modules are imported during test discovery, they affect subsequent tests
- Running tests in separate processes (by directory) avoids this issue
- This is a common problem in large test suites with dynamic imports
