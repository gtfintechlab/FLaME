[Explanation: The label 'HAWKISH' refers to an increase in the monetary policy's tightening stance, which often leads to a decrease in aggregate demand and, subsequently, a contraction in economic activity.]"

HAWKISH -- The FOMC is implementing a more hawkish monetary policy, which usually results in a tightening of monetary conditions, causing higher interest rates and reduced economic activity, thus leading to a more elevated inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields.

HAWKISH. This is an example of monetary policy tightening as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates to combat inflation. The explanation:- 'Shortfall' is used to refer to a deficit or a difference between GDP or economic growth and the inflation rate. Declining energy prices and non-energy import costs might indicate a tightening monetary policy, which aims to combat inflation by reducing the aggregate demand in the economy.'DOVISH.

DOVISH: If this sentence is related to an easing of the monetary policy, it can be labeled DOVISH. This is because a dovish stance typically involves reducing the money supply and making it easier to obtain credit, which can stimulate economic growth. NEUTRAL: The sentence being neutral, it can be labeled with NEUTRAL. This is because such a stance is neither tightening nor easing, but rather a balanced approach that the FOMC uses to maintain economic stability."

The explanation: Near-term costs refer to the adverse economic effects arising from the FOMC's decision, which are usually associated with a tightening of monetary policy.

It means the current policy is more focused on tightening the money supply and thus increasing rates to fight inflation.
DOVISH: The sentence describes the current monetary policy stance that focuses on dovish measures to encourage economic growth.

2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail."," The SIFIs are now better able to withstand a financial or other systemic shock than they were prior to the crisis.8
HAWKISH"

(Explanation: Businesses often raise prices to offset higher input costs, and a tightening of monetary policy generally results in higher input costs, hence the HAWKISH classification.)"
1,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","
HAWKISH - This label is used for sentences expressing tightening of the monetary policy, such as the one mentioned in the sentence. It is an acronym that stands for 'high' (as opposed to 'low') inflation, 'awkward' (as opposed to 'easy') policy, and 'concern' regarding possible adverse effects on the economy."
2,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","
HAWKISH (long-run equilibrium). Maximum employment and price stability are two critical components of an effective monetary policy. In the context of the sentence, the policy stance is most likely 'hawkish'. This is because the FOMC aims to maintain a long-term equilibrium of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"After falling steeply before the August FOMC meeting, emerging market equity prices were little changed, on net, over the period.","
HAWKISH - Steep decline in emerging market stock prices following the August FOMC meeting; monetary policy was tightened. Dovish - Small fluctuations in stock prices following the August FOMC meeting, indicating a relatively unchanged monetary policy stance. Neutral - Steady stock prices after the August FOMC meeting, implying a stable monetary policy."
0,"Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.","
HAWKISH - This label indicates a tightening of the monetary policy, as the FOMC members viewed the housing situation as a potential downside risk to the economic outlook and mentioned it as one of the major sources of such risk. The explanation is provided in the sentence itself."

Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols,"," the ABA President, and the members of our panel.2 Today, we are discussing the current economic outlook, and more importantly, the implications of this unprecedented global pandemic on the U.S. economy and its monetary policy. This week, we are also discussing various fiscal policies, including the Paycheck Protection Program, that have become critical to support the U.S. economy and the American worker in the current environment. Finally, the panel is going to provide some specific initiatives and ideas to help small businesses, especially women and minority-owned businesses, weather this pandemic. I'm excited to have this discussion. I look forward to hearing your perspectives. And I'm thrilled to be back on stage, in the room, with you. Thank you.

2,His conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information.,"
DOVISH - The sentence is discussing central banking and the conclusion relates to the monetary policy stance being eased, meaning it favors a market system with competition, free price-fixing, and decentralized knowledge utilization."
0,That's why I said that flexibility is also an important characteristic of monetary policy during a time of financial turmoil.,"
I'm sorry, I cannot classify this sentence as it contains subjective information regarding the author's stance on monetary policy. Please rephrase your query using factual statements."
2,"October 12, 2021 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting: Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a Diverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.","2 On a more serious note, I am pleased to discuss with the members of the institute the outlook for the U.S. economy and the role that monetary policy can play to promote economic and financial stability. I am particularly interested to share our thoughts on where the U.S. economy may be headed in the near term.3 In this regard, I do not have any updates on our monetary policy, which I expect will remain highly accommodative in the near term. In the meantime, however, monetary policy is a topic of ongoing discussion, and the FOMC continues to be very aware of its important role in maintaining an accommodative posture.4 I do not have any information at this time about where the committee may stand on this issue. I do know that they have been very focused on the labor market during the pandemic, and, as a result, have made substantial changes to their guidance on maximum employment. This is, in turn, helping to support the U.S. economy’s continued recovery. I am not aware of any specific changes in terms of the maximum employment rate, but I am confident that we will stay in close contact on this topic in the weeks and months ahead.5 I do believe that the U.S. economy can stay on an upward trend for the foreseeable future, as evidenced by the strong labor market, the solid economic activity, and the continuing rise of household income. In addition, there are many other positive signs, ranging from a very low unemployment rate, to a continued expansion of business investment, to a very broad-based recovery among many different types of businesses, to an increasingly favorable outlook on the global economy.6 In any event, the U.S. economy has come a long way since the beginning of the pandemic, and the recovery will continue to be on track for a while. In addition, I am very confident that the central bank will keep the pedal to the metal with regard to the fiscal and monetary measures that have been enacted, so as to maintain this robust recovery.7 I am looking forward to hearing from my colleagues at the meeting on these, as well as other important topics. I am sure that I can learn a lot from your insights in this year, and am very much looking forward to seeing everyone in person in Washington soon.1. Richard H. Clarida, ""Monetary Policy in the Age of Decarbonization,"" Remarks Presented at the Institute of International Finance, 2021 International Monetary Fund Annual Meeting, Oct. 12, 202"
1,Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,"
HAWKISH, explained in the sentence, is short for 'heightened monetary policy easing.' The explanation: Monetary policy can be tightened (HAWKISH) to combat inflation and/or reduce economic growth, or it can be eased (DOVISH) to stimulate growth and/or inflation. In this specific case, FOMC is referring to both maximum employment and price stability as dual-mandate goals, therefore using 'HAWKISH' aligns with their explanation."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the FOMC's decision on domestic and exports' relative strength which might lead to a continuation of large account deficits, thus labeling it DOVISH."
1,"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the FOMC members discussed a possible increase in inflation concerns. This is because the tightening of labor markets could lead to a rise in wages and, consequently, in prices, which might result in an overall increase in inflation. This would require an increment in the monetary policy's neutral stance."
2,An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.,"
HAWKISH: The risk premiums are characterized by high interest rates in line with the Fed's monetary policy to combat inflation. This indicates a tightening of the monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures.

(Explanation: HAWKISH refers to a risk premium associated with high interest rates, which is a monetary policy aimed at combating inflation, resulting in tight financial conditions.)"
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","
DOVISH - A dovish statement from FOMC regarding their monetary policy, as it indicates a cautious and relaxed approach, likely to result in a stable economy in the medium-term."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","
'DOVISH', Monetary policy: This sentence discusses changes in the monetary policy framework. The stance is neutral because it does not indicate an extreme change in policy, but rather a review of existing measures."
2,"So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated.","
FOMC: NEUTRAL. The sentence describes a mixed economic situation, with payroll employment and unemployment rate improving, yet remaining at relatively high levels. This is a neutral classification because there is no clear-cut monetary policy stance."
1,"In the view of a number of members, rapid growth of the monetary aggregates, though it had slowed very recently, was a further indication that financial conditions were not restraining economic activity.","
DOVISH. The recent slowdown in monetary aggregate growth indicates that economic activity is still expanding."
0,"Others indicated that because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate was associated with a reduction in labor force participation, the drop in the unemployment rate likely overstated the overall improvement in the labor market.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy was tightened, resulting in the decrease in jobless rate due to less people actively seeking employment. The decline in unemployment rate might have overshot as a result of less active job search.
DOVISH: The recent decline in the jobless rate might be attributed to a decrease in labor force participation, indicating limited job opportunities, rather than a true improvement in the labor market."
0,"indeed, inflation might edge a bit lower in the early stages of the expansion.","
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates a moderately hawkish monetary policy stance - a slight increase in short-term interest rates to combat rising inflation. The explanation for 'HAWKISH' is that the FOMC might slightly tighten the monetary policy to maintain a firm control on inflation."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","
FOMC sentence classification: HAWKISH - The monetary policy is being tightened, thus increasing the possibility of a rise in short-term interest rates. DOVISH - The monetary policy is being eased, indicating a possible decrease in short-term interest rates. NEUTRAL - The stance on the unemployment rate is balanced, so the monetary policy is not particularly focused on either tightening or easing."
0,"Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower energy prices.","
FOMC = 'FOOMCC' | HAWKISH: The sentence talks about inflation being low, which usually corresponds to tighter monetary policy; DOVISH: Since energy prices are low, easing monetary policy may be implied; NEUTRAL: Given the lack of significant information or context, the sentence can be classified as neutral."
2,"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","
HAWKISH. The sentence discusses a concern regarding price-level targeting, which is focused on achieving a higher short-term inflation rate than the long-term inflation objective. This implies a more aggressive monetary policy stance than the neutral reference value."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low," in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to maintain the Federal funds rate
DOVISH - In this case, the sentence refers to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to maintain the Federal funds rate, indicating a neutral stance on inflation."
1,"With today's action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core PCE inflation--would move slightly into positive territory.","
HAWKISH - This monetary policy decision is associated with a small and short-lived increase in the real federal funds rate, indicating an accommodative stance. The rationale behind this classification is that a hawkish monetary policy would lead to a rise in interest rates to combat inflation."
2,Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.,"
NEUTRAL. This sentence describes a current situation where members of the Federal Open Market Committee evaluate the economic outlook, and as a result, decide whether to keep monetary policy unchanged or adjust it. In this case, the outlook is seen as 'neutral,' which could either mean no immediate change in policy or a wait-and-see approach until more information is gathered. The sentence provides information about the monetary policy stance, which aids in categorizing it as 'HAWKISH,' 'DOVISH,' or 'NEUTRAL.'"
2,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating.","
HAWKISH: This is a monetary policy tightening sentence that indicates a faster-than-expected rise in inflationary pressures, as higher productivity may eventually lead to cost-price imbalances.
DOVISH: This is an easing sentence that suggests a slower-than-expected economic growth rate as it implies a less aggressive monetary policy stance.
NEUTRAL: This label indicates a neutral monetary policy that aims to maintain economic stability with no significant deviation from the previous stance, and thus, no immediate impact on inflation or growth."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC's decision to raise interest rates in 2017 was a hawkish move, as it indicated a tighter monetary policy, leading to an increase in national saving and potentially stronger economic growth. DOVISH: The sentence describes a dovish stance on monetary policy, given that it implies a relatively loose money supply, likely causing lower interest rates and possibly contributing to an environment of more accommodating financial conditions. NEUTRAL: In this case, the sentence presents a neutral policy as there is no specific mention of tightening or easing, leaving the stance uncertain."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","
DOVISH. This statement indicates that the Federal Reserve is considering gradually increasing the interest rates to promote a moderately strong economic growth and stable labor market conditions. The sentence describes a dovish monetary policy stance, which usually indicates a relatively loose and accommodative stance."
0,"Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.","
DOVISH; The sentence describes concerns about the longer-term repercussions of the pandemic, which might lead to economic restructuring, slower employment growth, or increased technological disruption, all of which might limit pricing power."
0,"For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.","
HAWKISH: This is an example of monetary policy tightening as the FOMC has indicated that the Committee will wait until substantial improvement in the labor market and price stability before considering further quantitative easing measures. The explanation: The FOMC's statement suggests that the current monetary policy stance is 'hawkish' and implies a cautious approach to future economic growth, focusing on sustainable improvements in the labor market and price stability."
0,"They remarked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the mentioned factors (a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices) typically lead to a tighter monetary policy, thus categorizing the statement as HAWKISH. A tightening monetary policy usually results in higher interest rates, which in turn can lead to reduced consumer spending, businesses investment, and production. This, in turn, can put downward pressure on inflation."
2,Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy and its effects on inflation in the context of three specific economies, likely indicating a more hawkish stance."
0,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is intended to reduce inflation by keeping interest rates relatively low. A neutral stance implies that the monetary policy is neither tightened nor loosened."
0,"remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","
HAWKISH - Higher-than-expected inflation; short-term, tighter monetary policy to combat price pressures; long-run equilibrium will likely see inflation move closer to 2 percent. Energy prices decline, along with non-energy import prices, which led to shorter-term tightening to avoid inflationary pressures."
2,"Notwithstanding these developments, some participants cautioned that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective should not be overstated","
HAWKISH - This classification is based on the assumption that the FOMC members are increasing the monetary policy's tightening bias, i.e., decreasing the amount of money supply, due to the current inflationary developments, which could lead to the slowdown in economic growth."
1,"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs.","
HAWKISH, as the employment rose strongly after a dip in April, indicating an accommodative monetary policy stance. However, the explanation should be provided in the label itself."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"
HAWKISH - Participants expected gradual strengthening of household demand due to increased wealth and fiscal support."
0,Improved prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China and accommodative monetary policy were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker-than-expected announcements of corporate earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 2019.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses favorable prospects for a trade deal between the US and China, highlighting the accommodative monetary policy stance. The explanation is: The sentence is classified as HAWKISH."
2,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,"
HAWKISH. This label indicates that the sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation (by reducing aggregate demand) in the short to medium term."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","
DOVISH. The monetary policy easing in the mid-1970s caused M1 money demand relationship breakdowns, which predicted faster growth than the actual observation."
2,"There is, in my view, a reasonable prospect that each of these two effects will reverse their contributions to inflation over the next couple of years and that balance between them will be important in determining the pattern of core and overall inflation rates.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses inflationary expectations and monetary policy. The term 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance that focuses on tighter money supply and higher interest rates to combat inflation. In this sentence, the FOMC's actions can be seen as tightening the policy, hence the HAWKISH label."
0,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","
DOVISH. This is because, as you mentioned, falling oil prices can lead to decreased demand and, consequently, lower inflation."
1,"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","
HAWKISH: Increases in oil prices are typically associated with monetary policy tightening, which would lead to higher interest rates and, ultimately, higher consumer energy prices. The statement implies that the FOMC sees current high oil prices as a result of this tightening."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","
DOVISH: The FOMC statement implies a cautious approach towards future money growth, maintaining a cautious monetary policy; thus, this sentence would be classified as DOVISH."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."," The Committee views monetary policies that increase the supply of money and credit as likely to result in a more rapid increase in output and prices than would be consistent with price stability. Monetary policies that increase the demand for money and credit are likely to result in a more rapid decline in price stability than those that result in an increase in the supply of money and credit.""
FOMC 'HAWKISH' explanation: The sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, which is characterized as 'open market operations' (money supply increase). This type of policy is typically associated with a tightening monetary policy that aims to curb inflation."
2,"Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.","
HAWKISH: The Federal Open Market Committee members suggest a neutral monetary policy stance, considering the varying nature of economic variables over time. The explanation is that they anticipate a data-dependent approach."
0,Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence describes monetary policy stance which is tightening. This label is applicable as the FOMC meeting was discussing monetary policy and recent survey readings indicate low inflation expectations."
0,Labor cost increases had not turned up and core inflation continued to edge lower.,"
HAWKISH. Core inflation is steadily decreasing, suggesting the monetary policy is becoming less restrictive."
2,A few observed that the combination of recent labor market improvements and continued softness in inflation had led them to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.,"
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the FOMC's monetary policy stance, which is characterized by a gradual tightening process. The term 'labor market improvements', combined with the reference to inflation softness, suggests the FOMC is moving in a hawkish direction, i.e., a tighter monetary policy."
2,"Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth.","
HAWKISH. This label indicates a tightening of monetary policy, as fiscal policy is expected to be less expansionary in the upcoming year, which usually leads to a less expansionary monetary policy as well."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","
DOVISH: Financial markets may develop instruments and analytical techniques to unearth implicit price level changes related to monetary policy tightening or the easing thereof."
2,"In their review of the outlook for prices, members noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had shown a slowing in core inflation from the high levels posted earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee's view that a portion of the earlier increase had reflected transitory factors.","
DOVISH. The sentence describes easing of the monetary policy due to the recent decrease in core inflation from high levels earlier in the year, indicating a transitory nature of the previous increase."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","
HAWKISH. This sentence discusses the FOMC's recent monetary policy decisions and their impact on emerging markets. The term 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance that aims to restrict economic growth, which is consistent with the FOMC's recent decisions to gradually reduce monetary stimulus and raise interest rates."
1,"In addition, the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of November showed that interest rates on C&I loans were generally little changed while spreads remained extremely wide.","
DOVISH - Declining overall monetary policy stance. The Survey of Terms of Business Lending suggests rates on C&I loans are relatively stable, yet spreads remain notably wide, indicating cautious lending environment."
2,Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.,"
HAWKISH - Participants agree that the labor market is strong and economic activity is moderate; monetary policy is tightened. DOVISH - Participants perceive the labor market and economy as stable; monetary policy is relaxed. NEUTRAL - The sentence presents a balanced view, with no clear preference for tightening or easing."
2,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.,"
HAWKISH - The FOMC is expected to tighten monetary policy, which will likely result in higher interest rates and potentially slower economic growth. Core inflation is likely to rise as a result. Dovish - The FOMC is expected to maintain a accommodative monetary policy stance, which may lead to an expansion in economic activity and an increase in core price inflation. Neutral - The FOMC's current policy stance might lead to a stable economy with balanced growth and inflation over time."
2,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,"
DOVISH. This sentence describes an aspect of monetary policy where the central bank controls the money supply by adjusting the rate at which it lends money to the commercial banks. In simpler terms, the Federal Reserve controls the money supply to maintain price stability."
0,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened, causing higher short-term nominal Treasury yields and lower inflation compensation. DOVISH: The monetary policy is being eased, causing lower short-term nominal Treasury yields and higher inflation compensation. NEUTRAL: The monetary policy is neutral, causing yields on both short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities to move in opposite directions, leading to an overall decrease in inflation compensation."
1,"These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs.","
DOVISH. The sentence describes an easing of monetary policy as the Federal Reserve is reducing the cost of business capital and the overall economic environment is improving. This is in contrast to the previous Hawkish stance, where the Fed was more focused on increasing the money supply to boost growth."
1,"the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.","
HAWKISH, as the housing market is in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates."
2,"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.","
HAWKISH - A hawkish monetary policy stance usually results in a relatively tight money supply and higher rates to control inflation. This sentence is labeled as HAWKISH due to the reference to a tightening monetary policy. The label explains that higher short-term interest rates and reduced money supply are typically employed to counter inflationary threats."
0,"Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term.","
DOVISH. This label means that the FOMC's current monetary policy stance is to gradually raise interest rates in the near term to keep inflation under control. The explanation is that the sentence mentions a moderate increase in wages and productivity, which are typically indicators of a tightening labor market, and thus, the central bank is expected to continue its monetary policy normalization process."
0,"Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes an economic environment where household spending is gradually increasing, but is still restricted by several factors like high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. These factors suggest a possible monetary policy stance that is neutral."
2,We have not seen wage growth pick up.,"
HAWKISH: In this sentence, 'We have not seen wage growth pick up,' the word 'hawkish' refers to the monetary policy stance being tightened, and thus this sentence is classified as HAWKISH."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"
HAWKISH: The speaker believes that the current low interest rates are appropriate for the economy, likely due to concerns about inflation or economic growth.
DOVISH: The speaker believes that the current monetary policy is too loose and may lead to inflation or economic overheating, hence urging for a more neutral stance.
NEUTRAL: The label suggests that the speaker sees the current monetary policy as balanced and does not have a strong opinion one way or the other."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."," It will be desirable to maintain monetary developments which have tended to move in a consistent manner with these macroeconomic goals. ""
HAWKISH The monetary policy is tightened, and it is expected to lead to a more stable price level and potential economic slowdown, aligning with the statement's goal of fostering price stability and promoting sustainable growth in output, hence HAWKISH label."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","
FOMC: DOVISH
Explanation: The sentence indicates that economic activity is currently more robust than previously perceived, which tends to reflect a tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve."
2,"Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC has reviewed the economic and financial conditions and decided to ease monetary policy, indicating a dovish stance. DOVISH: Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, indicating a neutral stance. NEUTRAL: The sentence does not provide sufficient information to classify the statement."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","
DOVISH. This label indicates a tightening of monetary policy as equity prices rose substantially, which would typically lead to a corresponding rise in short-term interest rates."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","
HAWKISH. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement is discussing the current stance of monetary policy, specifically the projection of core PCE inflation for this year. A tightening of the monetary policy would imply 'HAWKISH'. The label 'DOVISH' is used when there is an easing of monetary policy, and 'NEUTRAL' is used when there is no significant change in the current stance. This label helps provide clarity in understanding the FOMC's monetary policy decisions."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance in the context of a meeting in Jackson Hole, where Chair Jerome H. Powells emphasized the importance of keeping 'economic conditions under control,' implying a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
1,"some market-based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested continuing concern among market participants about the risk of higher medium-term inflation, perhaps reflecting large fiscal deficits and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC statement suggests increasing the Fed Funds Rate to combat rising inflation expectations. The label reflects a tightening of monetary policy.
DOVISH: The FOMC statement reflects an easing of monetary policy due to increasing inflation expectations. The label reflects a dovish stance.
NEUTRAL: The FOMC statement reflects a neutral monetary policy stance, given the neutral inflation projections."
2,"In contrast, economic activity declined in Japan during the third quarter after a surge in the first half of the year.","
DOVISH: Declining economic activity in Japan during the third quarter after a surge in the first half of the year. The explanation: The label 'DOVISH' is used as it indicates a tightening of the monetary policy, as economic activity is declining following a period of significant growth."
1,"Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build.","
HAWKISH The Federal Reserve raised interest rates in the July 2019 meeting to combat inflation and ensure market inflation expectations remain in check. This hawkish monetary policy stance indicates a possible reduction in aggregate demand and thus a tightening of the market."
0,"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.","
HAWKISH: Rising household spending in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments and enhanced unemployment benefits, is a sign of a potential V-shaped recovery, with a significant portion of the recovery likely to occur in the second quarter. This is because the fiscal support measures have a limited effect on economic growth, and the recovery is more likely to occur as businesses reopen, people go back to work, and additional fiscal support is provided."
2,"Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U. S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy.","
FOMC (HAWKISH), The sentence describes an economy that is being tightened, with the focus on the U.S. and its response to containment measures and fiscal policies."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","
HAWKISH: The sentence is referring to a tightening of the monetary policy stance, as indicated by the word 'hawkish'. DOVISH: The sentence is indicating an easing of the monetary policy stance, as the word 'dovish' refers to a dovish (i.e., cautious, not-eager) monetary policy. NEUTRAL: Given the neutral nature of the sentence, providing the label is unnecessary."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","
HAWKISH - This term refers to a tightening of the monetary policy. At the conclusion of theFOMC discussion, the Committee directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions in the System Account, based on current economic conditions that indicate robust activity. Explanation: The term 'hawkish', derived from the analogy to the hawkish behavior of an expert bird hunter, describes an approach characterized by increased, often aggressive, intervention in the economy. In this case, the 'expansion in economic activity' suggests the current growth, and the term 'tightening' refers to a less-aggressive stance on monetary policy."
2,The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy,"
DOVISH. This is because the unexpected rise in inflation expectations can make the central bank more cautious about implementing tightening policies that might trigger a slowdown or deflation, leading to more accommodative monetary policy in the short term."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","
FOMC - HAWKISH - When the Fed is expected to tighten monetary policy, markets often experience heightened volatility and interest rates rise. This usually results in a shift towards the HAWKISH label for EME countries. In this case, the label is applicable due to the significant decline in EME exchange rates and asset prices following Fed tapering anticipations."
1,The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.,"
Neutral. This sentence describes an economic situation where the monetary policy is on a relatively stable and neutral stance, with growth rates in line with expectations."
2,"You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus.","
HAWKISH. This is because the FOMC has been increasing interest rates in recent meetings, indicating a tightening of monetary policy which typically results in higher borrowing costs and hence a decrease in economic growth (e.g., lower demand for goods and services due to higher prices)."
0,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","
HAWKISH: Due to low interest rates, the servicing requirement for debt is relatively high, resulting in an elevated proportion of homeowners' income allocated toward debt repayment."
0,"Looking ahead, the projected slowing in the growth of final sales, including the effects of weak export markets, likely would reinforce business efforts to bring the growth of their inventories into better alignment with that of their sales, and such a development should contribute to the projected slowing in overall economic activity in coming quarters.","
DOVISH - The projected slowing in the growth of final sales, including the effects of weak export markets, likely would reinforce business efforts to bring the growth of their inventories into better alignment with that of their sales. This is because a slower growth in overall economic activity can be expected as a result. In the sentence, 'projected slowing in the growth of final sales' is considered HAWKISH, as it indicates a change in the monetary policy stance. The expected contribution of the slowing in economic activity to the overall outlook is labeled DOVISH."
0,"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","
NEUTRAL: The statement mentions a cooling of the housing market. It's a relatively recent development, and its impact on the economy is less clear. In this case, the term 'neutral' most accurately describes the current state of the housing market, which the Committee does not view as a primary driver of the overall economic activity."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"
DOVISH: The sentence refers to a scenario where the FOMC is preparing to tighten the monetary policy in response to emerging risks that might hinder the achievement of their goals. The reason behind this classification is that the sentence suggests that the Committee views the economic conditions as being in a 'hawkish' (tightening) stance, signaling their concern regarding possible risks."
1,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","
HAWKISH: The sentence is about the FOMC's monetary policy stance, specifically discussing the idea that additional firming may be needed depending on inflation and growth rates."
1,"Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports.","
HAWKISH - Increased monetary policy to combat inflation, often associated with higher interest rates. The label 'HAWKISH' reflects a tightening of the stance to combat inflation. 'DOVISH' would refer to a more lax monetary policy that might lead to an increase in inflation, or a lessening of the price rise in food and non-energy imports, while keeping the overall economy stable. 'NEUTRAL' describes a monetary policy stance that is not specifically focused on inflation control, but aims to maintain the economy's overall balance."
2,"In addition, at every policy meeting, each member of the MPC is operating with the same information from the staff, and before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report, the members have sat through a number of discussions covering all aspects of the forecast.","
DOVISH. This label indicates that the MPC members are discussing an easing of the monetary policy. The explanation: Members being informed with the same information, the focus on a quarterly Inflation Report, and discussions covering all aspects of the forecast are indicative of the MPC's dovish stance."
0,"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: In this context, the central bank is discussing the current monetary policy stance which is generally associated with tighter money supply to control inflation. The explanation is provided in the second line of the sentence."

DOVISH: The monetary policy is being tightened to maintain price stability and economic growth. Ex.: The Federal Open Market Committee sees risks tilted towards possible future economic weakness."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.","
DOVISH - The stance is characterized by a more accommodative monetary policy to encourage economic growth and lower inflation. The labor market and global supply chains are expected to adjust gradually, eventually leading to price inflation and wage gains without significant tightening."
2,"The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the FOMC discussed their monetary policy decisions, focusing specifically on their purchases. The term 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance characterized by an increased tendency towards tighter measures, aimed at controlling inflation and economic growth."
2,"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.","
HAWKISH: The movement of asset prices, especially equities and residential real estate, is an indicator of a more aggressive monetary policy stance. This typically results in higher interest rates and stricter financial conditions, which can lead to tighter credit and reduced spending. It can thus be an early warning sign of an impending economic downturn or a potential trigger for an imminent monetary policy change."
0,"First, the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation, both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods.","
HAWKISH; The significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has led to a decrease in U.S. inflation, as it has made imported goods pricier and domestic goods more competitively priced."
0,"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.","
HAWKISH. This is because depreciating other currencies may make U.S. exports cheaper than foreign goods, increasing the demand for U.S. products."
2,The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a situation where there is an increase in short-term interest rates to counteract inflationary pressures. This is a tightening of monetary policy. The explanation is the link between the strength of the US dollar and inflation dynamics."
1,"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.","
HAWKISH: The increase in interest rates is likely to lead to tighter monetary policy, causing adjustments in prices and debt-service obligations. DOVISH: The relatively stable monetary policy may lead to minimal price adjustments and debt-service obligations. NEUTRAL: The unchanged policy might result in small adjustments in prices and debt-service obligations, maintaining the current trends."
2,"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.","
FOMC sentence classifier response: HAWKISH. The sentence discusses the interaction between forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations in the context of globalization. The label 'HAWKISH' corresponds to tightening of the monetary policy, as the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations may lead to a decrease in the monetary ease."
0,And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.,"
FOMC - DOVISH. The reason is that the Fed mentions the unemployment rate being 'not yet at optimal levels', which implies a dovish stance."
2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","HAWKISH""
The FOMC sentence is classified as 'HAWKISH'.

This sentence indicates the FOMC's current stance is to maintain the current balance sheet size, hence the 'HAWKISH' classification."
1,"The economy continued to perform well into 2007, with solid growth through the third quarter and unemployment remaining near recent lows.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: The economy continued to perform well into 2007, with solid growth through the third quarter and unemployment near recent lows. This is because the FOMC had been gradually raising interest rates in 2006, thus implementing a hawkish monetary policy. (Explanation: Hawks, as a group, prefer more restrictive monetary policies, whereas doves prefer more accommodative policies. Thus, if the FOMC's actions indicate a hawkish stance, it would be classified as HAWKISH.)"
1,"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","
HAWKISH | Recent job gains and a low unemployment rate typically indicate a tightening monetary policy. (Explanation: Hawkish refers to a more aggressive monetary policy, which aims to reduce inflation and/or combat currency devaluation. Recent strong gains in employment and low unemployment suggest that the Fed is likely implementing this policy.)"
1,"It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right","
FOMC - HAWKISH: The sentence indicates an increase in the Fed's monetary policy stance to counterbalance the over-accelerated economy and potentially prevent inflationary pressures.

FOMC - DOVISH: The sentence points to a monetary policy easing, as the Fed is decreasing the current monetary policy to address an economic slowdown or to counterbalance the over-tight fiscal policy.

FOMC - NEUTRAL: The sentence implies the Fed's stance on monetary policy is neutral, maintaining the current policy stance to promote a stable and growing economy, not emphasizing any particular approach to counterbalancing the economy's productive potential."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","
FOMC sentence: DOVISH
Explanation: This sentence suggests that the FOMC may be considering easing their monetary policy to keep inflation in check, as suggested by the literature."
0,Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.,"
DOVISH - This classification is given for monetary policy that is expected to decrease economic growth and/or raise inflation. Lower economic growth can be a result of tighter monetary policy (e.g., reducing the money supply), which might lead to a decline in employment and consequently increasing unemployment. This is the opposite of the HAWKISH stance where more monetary policy stimulus is expected to combat unemployment."
0,"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is increasing short-term interest rates to combat inflationary pressures, which often accompany accommodative monetary policies. In this case, the long-term bond market sees more stable inflation projections, and the rate hike might lead to a tightening of financial conditions in the short term.
DOVISH: The FOMC is reducing the monetary stimulus as the economy strengthens, causing market participants to reassess their inflation expectations, and inflationary pressures decrease. Consequently, the bond market might anticipate a more accommodative stance in the future."
2,"But I have showed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants.","
DOVISH. The sentence indicates a reduction in vacancies can lead to a softer landing anticipated by FOMC participants; thus, it aligns with their expected dovish monetary policy stance."
1,"In a virtuous circle, stable inflation expectations help the central bank to keep inflation low even as it retains substantial freedom to respond to disturbances to the broader economy.","
DOVISH. This sentence implies that the FOMC is currently in a moderately tight monetary policy stance. The explanation is that inflation expectations are being kept in check, which is a hawkish approach, as monetary policy is restrictive."
2,and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.,"
'DOVISH' Label: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance where the objective is to keep inflation in line with a flexible inflation-targeting central bank, which usually involves adjusting monetary policy to achieve a specific inflation rate or growth path.

Explanation: In this example, the FOMC is described as setting monetary policy in a way similar to a flexible inflation-targeting central bank, using inflation as a tool to achieve a specific growth rate or path."
2,"The unemployment rate was unchanged over the period between the April and June meetings,","
FOMC meeting dates: April 30 - June 18
HAWKISH"
0,But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.,"
NEUTRAL: The sentence discusses the possibility that the current economic growth rate will decrease in the upcoming year. It can be labelled as NEUTRAL due to its neutral reference to a slowdown in growth."
2,"In our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target range at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","
DOVISH This statement indicates the FOMC anticipates a moderately loose monetary policy to maintain economic growth and stability. The explanation is that 'DOVISH' stands for 'decidedly optimistic view on inflation and growth'."
2,"In particular, a surprise tightening of policy raises the risk premium, lowering current stock prices, and a surprise easing lowers the risk premium, raising current stock prices.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC statement mentions increasing the risk premium on account of an unexpected tightening of monetary policy. This would typically lead to a higher likelihood of higher stock prices as investors react to the unexpected change in the market conditions."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","
DOVISH - In this sentence, 'DOVISH' stands for 'Data-based, Oligarchic, Very Stricten, Incrementalist' classification. The sentence describes a neutral stance on future policy adjustments, implying that policymakers would consider multiple factors like inflation and economic growth, taking quantitative data into account."
1,"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year.","
DOVISH - This is because the FOMC had tightened monetary policy earlier this year, causing oil prices to rise."
2,Table 2 Distribution of Employment and of Displaced Workers by Industry Category Industry Employment Displaced Workers Restructuring 23.1 42.2 Nonrestructuring 76.9 57.8 Total 100 100 Source: Displaced Worker Supplement to the CPS.,"

DOVISH - In this sentence, the focus is on the duration of elevated inflation. The sentence is a bit lengthy and describes the concept of inflation targeting. It falls in the DOVISH category since it indicates that the central bank might be more accommodative to moderate inflation."
2,Our tools work on demand.,"
HAWKISH, explanation: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) implements monetary policy tools like increasing interest rates to tighten the economy, which leads to a demand-pulled growth strategy. Examples of this strategy include higher wages, increased business investments, and higher consumer spending."
2,"In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy stance as tightening, which tends to raise interest rates and decrease money supply, potentially leading to higher inflation."
2,"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?","
NEUTRAL - This is because the sentence discusses a general concept related to economic recessions, rather than an immediate application of a particular monetary policy."
2,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.","
HAWKISH - The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates in the near term to combat inflation worries. (Explanation: Hawks typically tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, thus leading to higher interest rates.)"
2,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes the Fed's decision regarding monetary policy, mentioning a long-term goal of price stability and sustainable growth. The decision to slightly raise the federal funds rate could be labeled as tightening, as it indicates a more restrictive stance."
2,"Conversely, perhaps the transitory factors boosting productivity will recede more sharply than most observers anticipate, and the output gap will close more rapidly.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes an easing of monetary policy, which usually results in a reduction in interest rates and an increase in money supply to stimulate economic growth. In this case, the output gap is likely to close more rapidly as a result of the transitory nature of the productivity boost."
2,A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,"
HAWKISH: The FOMC statement mentions monetary policy in relation to the current economic conditions and the possible future changes. It implies a hawkish stance, as the Fed is considering a potential tightening of monetary policy.

DOVISH: The sentence focuses on the current US economic situation and the possible future trends, without explicitly mentioning monetary policy. It could be considered dovish because the Fed's current accommodative stance might not be tightened in the near future."
2,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,"
HAWKISH - The sentence refers to the reduction in monetary and fiscal policy stimulus, which typically results in a tightening of economic conditions. This might lead to increased interest rates and energy-related headwinds in the long term."

HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance tightened as a result of elevated inflation readings, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
2,"In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.","
HAWKISH The Federal Open Market Committee recently voted to keep interest rates on hold, which is often perceived as a dovish policy. In this sentence, home mortgage debt appears to have'slowed a bit further', suggesting a tightening monetary policy, thus assigning the label HO."
0,"In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective.","
DOVISH: The sentence mentions'muted inflation pressures,' which is an indication of a dovish monetary policy stance."
2,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.,"
HAWKISH, as it refers to tightening of the monetary policy. High inflation was a significant economic issue in the past and current generations. The explanation: 'HAWKISH' refers to a monetary policy which aggressively combats inflation by increasing interest rates and reducing money supply.

2,inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.,"
HAWKISH: This sentence describes an increase in the Fed's monetary policy. Energy prices are decreasing, leading to a projection of gradually increasing inflation. The label reflects the tightening stance of the monetary policy."
1,"Moreover, theory and intuition tell us that monetary credibility will be greatest when the central bank does what it is supposed to do: offset economic shocks to keep price pressures from building and thereby keep inflation itself low and stable.","

HAWKISH - The Fed indicated an intention to maintain a more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and combat inflation. The explanation: Hawkish refers to a monetary policy stance that is expected to lead to an increase in short-term interest rates and a decline in money supply."
2,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.","25%
HAWKISH - This stance means the monetary policy is becoming more restrictive or Hawk-like, typically associated with a rise in rates to combat inflation. The rationale behind this label includes the reference to the word 'hawkish' which describes an individual or group who favors an aggressive or confrontational approach in decision-making, and the policy's tightening bias."
1,"Indeed, virtually every forecast projects a modest rise in broad measures of U.S. inflation this year, reflecting the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, most importantly the reversal in the path of oil prices, the stabilization of commodity prices and non-oil import prices, and some rebound in health care costs.","
HAWKISH - An increase in the money supply, causing inflation; DOVISH - A decrease in the money supply to combat inflation; NEUTRAL - A stable monetary policy with low inflation."
2,"Employment continued to expand unevenly,","

0,It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.,"
HAWKISH - Because it refers to tightening the monetary policy, lower unemployment may have been seen as a desirable target. The explanation: At the time, the FOMC was likely discussing whether the current program (7 percent unemployment goal) would require aggressive asset purchases, which could be seen as Hawkish."
0,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.","
HAWKISH, Because the FOMC discusses interest rates related to inflation and employment. DOVISH, as it refers to easing monetary policy to boost the economy. NEUTRAL, as it implies a relatively balanced approach or no specific stance on the current monetary policy."
2,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,"
DOVISH. During the 1950s-80s, monetary policy was often used to combat inflation and economic fluctuations. The Federal Reserve would increase interest rates and tighten monetary policy to discourage borrowing and spending, thus reducing economic growth. This approach, known as 'hawkish' or 'dovish,' was often associated with countercyclical fiscal policies that aimed to reduce deficits and promote savings. However, in recent decades, central banks have adopted more accommodative policies during economic downturns, relying on tools such as quantitative easing to stimulate growth. Consequently, the FOMC's decisions on monetary policy are less focused on countercyclical adjustments and more on achieving long-term growth and maintaining economic stability."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","

1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","
NA: Neutral. The sentence does not provide information about the stance of monetary policy, therefore it cannot be classified as HAWKISH, DOVISH, or NEUTRAL."
0,"They also generally expected that inflation would remain, for some time, below levels the Committee considers most consistent, over the longer run, with maximum employment and price stability.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses monetary policy stance, indicating that the Fed sees a relatively long period with low inflation."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","
HAWKISH: The stance is hawkish as it suggests an expected monetary policy tightening to alleviate inflationary pressures. This may lead to higher interest rates and reduced aggregate demand, eventually causing a slowdown in economic activity."

1,"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.","
DOVISH; Recent high inflation readings suggest a possible shift in the monetary policy stance, indicating the Fed may be moving towards tightening the money supply to combat inflation."
2,Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.,"
DOVISH - The sentence refers to an advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks, which are typically associated with a tightening of the monetary policy."
1,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.","
HAWKISH Explanation: The sentence mentions May 1, 2019, which is likely referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting that month. Given the central bank's tendency to tighten policies during inflationary periods, it's a reasonable assumption that this meeting would have been tightening, hence the HAWKISH label."
0,"Low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in recent months, as well as the weakened economic outlook, kept near-term inflation expectations reported in surveys well below their high levels in mid-2008.","
HAWKISH, (0.8) The current low inflation expectations might indicate a tightening monetary policy by the Fed."
2,Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.,"

NEUTRAL. This sentence describes a relatively stable economic situation, where the effects of the current monetary policy on household spending are somewhat mitigated by other factors such as higher employment and lower energy prices."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","
HAWKISH. This label indicates the monetary policy stance is Hawkish or is likely to remain hawkish in the near term, given the focus on economic growth and the intention to keep the economy close to full employment."

HAWKISH - Because the FOMC is uncertain about the effectiveness of QE in the short term, and the asset-purchase program is not on a preset schedule, the stance remains neutral.  The labor market and inflation assessments are critical factors in determining the Committee's decisions on asset purchases, so the HAWKISH label reflects their influence on this dovish monetary policy."

2,"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.","
HAWKISH. This is a monetary policy tightening and typically results in higher interest rates. Ex post monetary policy success leads to market expectations of higher inflation, which can cause real rates to adjust pro-cyclically."

These projections are typically viewed as a key determinant in the formulation of monetary policy. A tightening of the monetary policy would generally be associated with the term 'hawkish', which is characterized by a more aggressive stance towards controlling inflation and promoting economic growth."
1,"However, the historical record suggests that permanently lowering inflation expectations may require keeping monetary policy tight for a substantial period, resulting in considerable output and employment losses for a time.","

HAWKISH - This classification is based on the FOMC's statement that they will maintain a flexible monetary policy stance, accommodating economic fluctuations, while also striving for long-run price stability. This means the central bank has leeway in implementing policies to address immediate economic challenges. 

DOVISH - This classification is based on the implication that the FOMC will maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance, with a focus on promoting aggregate demand. This includes the use of tools like quantitative easing and/or lowering the Fed Funds Rate to stimulate economic growth.

NEUTRAL - If the statement provides no clear guidance or leaning, this classification is applied to maintain a balanced perspective. It implies that the FOMC's stance is relatively accommodative and neutral, and that there is room for the central bank to employ various tools depending on macroeconomic conditions."
2,One measure of the decline in recent years of the marginal cost of additions to oil availability is the downdrift in the prices of the most distant contracts for future delivery of Light Sweet crude oil.,"

0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","
HAWKISH - This is a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. In this scenario, the FOMC is taking measures to reduce the money supply and decrease aggregate demand to combat high inflation. The explanation is necessary because FOMC members must decide the stance of monetary policy (e.g., hawkish or dovish) considering various factors such as inflation, economic growth, and geopolitical risks."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","
HAWKISH - The stance is hawkish because it implies a tighter monetary policy, which would lead to higher interest rates and decreased economic growth.DOVISH - The stance is dovish because it indicates a more expansionary monetary policy, which would lead to lower interest rates and likely higher economic growth.NEUTRAL - The stance is neutral because the emphasis on the public's understanding of inflation costs implies a cautious, non-inflationary monetary policy."
0,"Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand.","
HAWKISH: Because the sentence discusses inflation concerns and the FOMC's expectations for long-term unemployment as a result of increased aggregate demand, it is labelled as 'HAWKISH' in this case. DOVISH: If the sentence indicates that the FOMC's monetary policy might become more restrictive in the near term to address inflation concerns (i.e., tightening), it would be labelled as 'DOVISH'. NEUTRAL: Since the sentence does not specify any particular monetary policy stance, and the possibility of sustained high levels of long-term unemployment might lead to higher structural unemployment, it is considered 'NEUTRAL'."
1,"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices.","
DOVISH. Members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices."
2,"We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC believes further monetary policy tightening is necessary to address inflation and economic growth.   DOVISH - The FOMC anticipates a more expansionary monetary policy to stimulate growth and counteract deflation concerns.   NEUTRAL - The FOMC keeps its monetary policy stance neutral, as it aims to avoid overheating in the economy, fostering price-stability, and maintaining financial stability."
1,"In light of the robust expansion of capital spending thus far this year, the outlook for business investment spending was revised up appreciably, as more of the strength over the latter part of 2004 was attributed to underlying demand and less to the effects of the partial-expensing tax provision.","
HAWKISH: The Federal Reserve's recent decision to tighten monetary policy, resulting from the robust growth in capital spending this year, leads to an upward revision of the outlook for business investment spending. This classification is based on the sentence's description of the current monetary policy stance as tightening."
1,The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated.,"
DOVISH: The sentence describes an easing of monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its benchmark rate at a relatively low level for a prolonged period might lead to a decrease in the money supply and subsequently, a slowdown in economic growth, causing employment gains to exceed anticipations."
1,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.","9%
HAWKISH - The Federal Open Market Committee increased the federal funds rate to combat inflation. (Explanation: Hawkish refers to a monetary policy move aimed at reducing economic growth to combat inflation.)"
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","
DOVISH This sentence discusses monetary policy and its potential impact on the economy. In this case, the Fed's response to a rapid increase in interest rates may involve not remitting funds to the Treasury, which could lead to difficulties for the central bank in terms of congressional approval and public opinion."
2,"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes a dovish stance on monetary policy, indicating that the FOMC may decrease the money supply to combat inflation."
0,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is expected to tighten monetary policy, which could lead to a decline in economic growth and a stronger US dollar, thereby decreasing exports, imports, and likely real GDP. DOVISH: In this instance, the FOMC is expected to ease monetary policy, which may result in increased economic growth and a weaker US dollar, thus boosting exports, imports, and possibly real GDP. NEUTRAL: Given the uncertainty surrounding the FOMC's actions and the balance between domestic expansion and global economic conditions, it is hard to classify this sentence."
1,"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the labor market and inflation, indicating that monetary policy should be tightened to address these conditions."

1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.","
HAWKISH: The statement indicates a tightening of the monetary policy due to the decline in the neutral level of the federal funds rate and the binding constraint on inflation and employment."
1,Home prices continued to rise briskly.,"
HAWKISH, home prices continued to rise rapidly due to the recent monetary policy tightening. The monetary policy tightening led to higher interest rates, causing borrowers to reduce mortgage applications, ultimately decreasing home sales and slowing the housing market."
2,Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net.,"
DOVISH. This label indicates a decrease in broad equity indexes, which usually suggests a tightening of monetary policy. The explanation is based on the notion that changes in the money supply, typically associated with monetary policy adjustments, can have an impact on equity prices."
2,"I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.","
HAWKISH - In an effort to tighten monetary policy, the Federal Open Market Committee ('FOMC') is raising interest rates. The explanatory statement alludes to various factors, including incoming data, influencing projections."
2,"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States.","
DOVISH. The sentence indicates that, in contrast to a tightening of the monetary policy that might typically accompany an economic upturn, a recovery in the United States would likely be the cause of an upturn in foreign economic activity."

HAWKISH: Inflation appears to be under control and moving in a favorable direction. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been actively implementing monetary policies to reduce inflationary pressures.
DOVISH: The current monetary policy is accommodating, and there's a decrease in inflationary pressures. The FOMC's recent decisions reflect a shift towards a more dovish stance.
NEUTRAL: The current monetary policy stance is relatively neutral, with inflationary pressures gradually declining but not yet at a level to preclude further accommodation if needed."
1,"Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses.","
HAWKISH, as it indicates an increase in monetary policy tightness. This is because it mentions firms raising prices in response to strong demand, indicating a restrictive monetary environment."
1,"During the period examined, the rate of overall consumer inflation was 2.78 percent, as measured by the regular CPI-U for All Items.","
HAWKISH. This label represents a tightening of the monetary policy, as the sentence indicates a moderate increase in overall consumer inflation. The reason for classifying it as HAWKISH is that it is commonly associated with an increase in short-term interest rates to combat inflation."
2,participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term.,"
DOVISH; This classification is based on the expectation of moderate growth in consumer spending in the near term, which would indicate a tightening of the monetary policy."
1,"From a low near $30 per barrel in late 2003, the price of oil rose to $70 per barrel by the middle of 2006, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $80.","
HAWKISH The Fed has been gradually increasing interest rates to combat inflation and decrease the demand for oil. The current price of oil hovering near $80 might reflect the ongoing hawkish monetary policy."
2,Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates?,"
DOVISH: Rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limits the ability of domestic monetary policy to influence domestic interest rates, as external factors may dominate over domestic policy decisions."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"
DOVISH The sentence is classified as DOVISH because it indicates the FOMC's projection for U.S. economic activity being upward-sloping, which typically indicates a tighter monetary policy."
2,A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,"
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the FOMC's review of their monetary policy framework, focusing specifically on their assessment of the economic environment and their strategy for achieving maximum employment and price stability. The monetary policy framework is characterized as evolving, requiring ongoing adjustments to adapt to changing economic conditions and ensure optimal outcomes. The sentence is neutral in nature and does not provide specific guidance on the stance of the monetary policy."
2,"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","
NEUTRAL. This sentence discusses Fed Chair Jerome Powell's forward guidance regarding the current monetary policy stance, emphasizing a data-dependent approach as he assesses the evolving economic conditions. The label 'NEUTRAL' indicates that the text is not a specific monetary policy recommendation, but rather an assessment of the current stance based on evolving economic conditions."
2,"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a situation where a central bank is increasing the monetary policy to control inflation and put more emphasis on prices. The term 'DOVISH' means 'in favor of tighter monetary policy' as opposed to 'HAWKISH' which stands for 'in favor of an easier monetary policy' and 'NEUTRAL' which means there is no preference on the side of monetary policy."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.","
HAWKISH - This sentence discusses the surprise strength in economic activity, indicating the FOMC views it as a hawkish stance."
2,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","
HAWKISH: Expectation of low-to-stable inflation in the near term leading to monetary policy tightening. (Explanation: Hawks refer to a monetary policy that is expected to increase interest rates in the near term to combat inflation.)"
1,"Monetary policy clearly can do little about the first-round effects of a permanent rise in energy prices, which include both its direct impact on the energy component of overall consumer prices and the pass-through of higher energy costs into prices of non-energy goods and services.","
DOVISH The sentence describes a monetary policy neutral stance, as it acknowledges the ineffectiveness of policy in dealing with the first-round effects of a permanent rise in energy prices. The rationale behind the explanation is that, even though central bankers may attempt to counteract the direct effects of higher energy costs, it ultimately has little influence on the overall economy due to the pass-through effect on prices of non-energy goods and services."
1,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.,"
DOVISH. This label is given as inflation targeting via monetary policy has tightened, which means there is less money supply and hence lower prices of goods and services."
2,"There is, in fact, an unusual discrepancy between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates, compared to previous expansions",".
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an unusual discrepancy between unemployment and capacity utilization rates, which usually indicates a tightening of the monetary policy. This is a hawkish (or tightening) stance."
2,"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.","
HAWKISH: Due to the significant decrease in economic activity and high unemployment after the 2008 global financial crisis, the FOMC adopted a highly accommodative monetary policy stance, leading to a delay in the recovery of inflation and employment to their pre-crisis levels."
0,"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.","
FOMC sentence: NEUTRAL
Explanation: The sentence doesn't provide enough information to classify it as HAWKISH or DOVISH. The focus on the recovery and the lack of clear guidance on inflation management suggest a neutral stance."
2,"With respect to this particular part of the District, Jack may discuss Florida's citrus crop, the relative health of the tourism industry, and trends in Florida real estate prices.","
DOVISH: The sentence discusses the tourism industry, real estate prices and Florida-specific aspects. It can be labeled as DOVISH because it touches on the local market."
1,"In particular, investors noted that the Committee attributed some of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors, retained its earlier balance of risks assessment, and reiterated its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured.","
HAWKISH: This monetary policy decision signals a hawkish stance, as it involves tightening of the current monetary policy. The reason behind it could be an attempt to combat rising inflation rates. 

DOVISH: This decision represents a dovish stance on monetary policy, as it indicates a committee's inclination towards easing the current policy measures. The reasoning behind it could be a desire to counterbalance the effects of economic downturns or slowdowns.

NEUTRAL: In this case, the central bank's decision maintains a neutral stance on monetary policy, as they have not changed the current policy measures and have simply acknowledged transitory factors related to inflation."
2,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","
HAWKISH - The Federal Open Market Committee has raised short-term interest rates in recent months to combat inflation and monetary policy is currently tight, thus the sentence can be classified as HAWKISH."
2,continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.,"
FOMC (HAWKISH) - This classification applies when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is implementing a hawkish monetary policy, i.e., increasing the interest rates to combat inflation and slow the economy's expansion.
FOMC (DOVISH) - This classification applies when the FOMC is implementing a dovish monetary policy, i.e., reducing the interest rates to stimulate the economy's expansion and growth.
FOMC (NEUTRAL) - This classification applies when the FOMC's monetary policy stance is neutral or there are no specific changes in the interest rates. In this case, the short-term economic outlook is expected to remain favorable but with some uncertainties in the medium-term."
2,"However, several participants pointed out that the 3-month change in that index had firmed recently, signaling some improvement in the inflation outlook.","
HAWKISH: As the sentence indicates an increase in inflation expectations, the label is applied. The explanation: A hawkish monetary policy stance is characterized by a higher chance of interest rate increases, which could lead to tighter credit conditions and eventually higher price levels, in this case, firmed inflation expectations."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to the FOMC's decision to raise the interest rates, which is a tightening of the monetary policy in order to combat inflationary pressures. This classification reflects the view that the risks associated with inflation are being addressed.

DOVISH: The sentence reflects a dovish monetary policy stance, as the FOMC has chosen not to raise interest rates, but instead opted to keep them low in order to promote economic growth. Lower interest rates could lead to an increase in borrowing and spending, potentially driving up inflationary pressures, thus warranting the term 'DOVISH'. 

NEUTRAL: The sentence represents a neutral stance on the current monetary policy as the FOMC has not changed the rates. This classification implies that the policy is not too tight or too loose, but rather in line with the current neutral stance, hence the term 'NEUTRAL'."
2,"another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes an inflationary environment where the Fed is actively implementing monetary policy to control price increases. This could indicate a tightening of the monetary policy, as the central bank is increasing the money supply to decrease consumer spending and reduce inflation."
2,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,"
HAWKISH: The term monetary hawk is often used to describe an FOMC member who is more aggressive in raising interest rates and monetary policy tightenings. In this instance, the sentence could be classified as HAWKISH due to the mention of'monetary policy.'
DOVISH: The term dovish is used to describe an FOMC member who is more accommodative in their monetary policy, often characterized by low interest rates and easy money. In this sentence, the use of the phrase 'What does this mean for monetary policy?' may suggest a dovish stance.
NEUTRAL: In this instance, the term neutral refers to a member who is not particularly hawkish or dovish, typically following a non-partisan monetary policy. A sentence like 'What does this mean for monetary policy?' may not provide enough information to classify the sentence as HAWKISH, DOVISH, or NEUTRAL."
1,"subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the December CPI release.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance is becoming more hawkish. The US economy is strengthening, and there are higher prices for goods and services due to the strengthening trend. The central bank is expected to raise interest rates in the near future.

(Explanation: Hawkish refers to an increase in the monetary policy stance, which is characterized by relatively tighter policies, and is typically associated with higher rates, as the central bank tries to combat inflation.)"
1,"Key factors that influence consumer spending--including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation, and still elevated measures of households' net worth--were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term.","
HAWKISH. Expansionary monetary policy can lead to increased investment, employment, and economic growth, which can boost consumer spending, ultimately resulting in a HAWKISH-coded sentence. The explanation is that monetary policy affects consumer spending indirectly by impacting business investments, which, in turn, affects employment and economic growth, which can contribute to a HAWKISH-coded sentence."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","
DOVISH: This sentence describes expectations of short-term interest rates remaining low for a prolonged period, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy stance."
1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.","
DOVISH: The monetary policy is being tightened due to inflationary concerns and supply-chain issues."
1,"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.","
HAWKISH: Because the central bank is increasing interest rates to contain market speculation and maintain macroeconomic stability, the sentence is categorized as HAWKISH. This is the case as it corresponds to tightening of the monetary policy, which typically reduces business and consumer spending to mitigate inflationary pressures."
1,"The expansion of M2 had declined substantially since late spring, apparently in part as a result of the widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2 stemming from higher market interest rates and possibly also from slackening growth in household incomes.","
DOVISH Explanation: In this sentence, the M2 expansion appears to have slowed down due to higher interest rates and weaker growth in household incomes, which could indicate a shift from expansionary monetary policy to a more neutral stance."
0,"In addition, to address the sizable demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions, the FOMC authorized the expansion of its existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank; by the end of the intermeeting period, the formal quantity limits on these lines had been eliminated.","
HAWKISH, explanation: Hawks tighten monetary policy to combat inflation or to reduce excessive money supply. The FOMC decision to expand dollar funding swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank is indicative of a hawkish stance as it allows for increased demand of dollars in foreign jurisdictions."
2,"Further evidence that firms still have not fully adapted their operations to the latest state of technology also is provided in a recent study4 that attempts to measure the ""technological gap""--that is, the difference between the productivity of leading-edge capital and the average productivity embodied in the current capital stock.","
HAWKISH, because the sentence is indicating that the Fed has recently eased monetary policy to encourage firms to adapt their operations to the latest technology."
2,"On balance, most participants still expected inflation to moderate later this year and in 2009.","
HAWKISH | This label indicates that the FOMC members expect a slight increase in inflation. In this case, the monetary policy is being tightened, which is typically associated with higher inflation."
1,"And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend demand for our liabilities.","
FOMC sentence classification: HAWKISH; The monetary policy stance is being tightened, as indicated by the phrase'slow the pace of purchases.'"
2,"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, asset prices are discussed from a macroeconomic perspective, focusing on the link between changes in asset prices and household consumption and business investment, which can lead to monetary policy decisions. The term 'hawkish' describes a monetary policy stance that is expected to result in tighter measures."
1,The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers.,"
HAWKISH (price stability) - The term 'hawkish' is used to refer to a monetary policy stance that is more focused on controlling inflation and maintaining price stability, typically through tighter monetary policy measures. The explanation is that central banks often increase interest rates to combat inflation, reducing the money supply to decrease demand and thereby increasing prices."
0,"These participants cited, for example, the still-elevated levels of long-term unemployment and workers employed part time for economic reasons as well as low labor force participation.","
HAWKISH - The sentence refers to the Fed's recent monetary policy tightening and its effects on the labor market, employment, and economic growth. This classification reflects the participants' concerns about the high level of long-term unemployment and workers in part-time jobs."
0,"Employment had risen a little,"," with 1.2 million jobs added over the past year
HAWKISH: In this sentence, employment has been increasing slightly, hinting at an upcoming tightening of the monetary policy. This is labeled HAWKISH because it anticipates a change in the current loose monetary policy."
1,"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","
HAWKISH: In FOMC meetings, the Fed frequently changes the interest rates to adjust the supply of money and credit. If they overshoot and ease policy too much, it's likely to lead to market volatility and a potential rise in inflation. (Inflationary pressure can result from excessive money supply and lower lending standards, causing a decline in consumer and business confidence.)"
2,A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.,"
DOVISH This sentence discusses the FOMC's assessment of structural productivity, which can have implications for price inflation and labor costs. The term 'DOVISH' is used because it implies a tightening of monetary policy, as it suggests that the FOMC views structural productivity as a key factor that could lead to higher costs and thus may lean toward a more restrictive stance."
0,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","
LABEL: HAWKISH EXPLANATION: This sentence discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decisions on monetary policy to address high unemployment. In particular, the FOMC aims to decrease unemployment by encouraging employment opportunities for individuals who have been jobless for a long time."
0,"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is.","
HAWKISH: The phrase 'where it currently is' implies a reference to current, relatively tight monetary policy."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"
HAWKISH: Members discussed the recent inflationary pressures and agreed to continue monitoring the situation intently, indicating an impending monetary policy tightening stance. The sentence is classified as HAWKISH because it is a tightening of the monetary policy."
2,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.","
HAWKISH: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision to increase short-term interest rates is typically associated with an economy in or approaching a recession, and thus it may lead to a tightening of credit conditions, decreased business investments, reduced consumer spending, lower stock prices, and tighter financial market conditions. In this particular sentence, the FOMC's decision to raise short-term interest rates indicates their expectation of a potential recession or tightening of the monetary policy.DOVISH: In contrast to HAWKISH, a dovish stance from the Fed usually signals a more accommodating monetary policy stance to promote economic growth, as lower interest rates encourage borrowing, spending, business investments, and trade (both exports and imports). This is why the short-term federal funds rate has a significant impact on financial markets and real activity. In this case, the sentence suggests the Fed's expectation of a slow economic recovery, or at least a more accommodative monetary policy in the near future.NEUTRAL: If the sentence does not provide enough information to classify it in either category, we cannot confidently determine the central bank's monetary policy stance or its impact on financial markets and real activity."
0,"Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed markedly across the credit spectrum, most notably for debt securities of the lowest credit quality firms.","
HAWKISH
The text describes an increase in the monetary policy, which tends to decrease borrowing and investments in the economy, resulting in a reduction of corporate bond yields. This tightening of monetary policy is associated with higher rates and a decrease in risk aversion."
2,"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy, focusing on an important input, inflation expectations. The label is used due to the reference to an actively controlled policy tool ('u*') and the focus on the state of an inflationary expectation ('inflation expectations')."
0,But equity prices were only holding their own after a substantial decline earlier and the dollar had appreciated.,"
HAWKISH The sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is more focused on tightening. The explanation is based on the reference to a substantial decline in equity prices and the dollar's appreciation, which are typically associated with a tighter monetary policy."
0,"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC statement indicates that the central bank aims to tighten monetary policy, which often leads to higher interest rates and a stronger USD. In this case, the'moderately above 2 percent' reference likely alludes to a rate hike in the near future, hence tightening the monetary policy."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"
HAWKISH: The view that monetary policy should not be influenced by financial market bubbles tends to be associated with Hayekian monetary theory and classical economics. It is characterized by a focus on the long-term stability of the economy and monetary policy that is counter-cyclical to business cycle fluctuations. The FOMC might adopt HAWKISH policies in order to prevent or mitigate financial market bubbles."
0,"While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.","
NEUTRAL | Explanation: The sentence describes a scenario where members of the FOMC acknowledge improvements in economic conditions but maintain a cautious approach, suggesting that further improvement in the labor market is necessary before considering a slowdown in asset purchases."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.","
HAWKISH - The stance is tightening monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve is increasing the interest rates to control inflation. DOVISH - The stance is neutral, as the Federal Reserve is keeping the monetary policy stable in order to avoid inflation. NEUTRAL - The sentence does not contain enough information to classify the stance."
2,"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","
DOVISH. This label indicates that the FOMC's decision regarding monetary policy is to decrease it, thus decreasing the money supply, leading to tighter credit conditions, and likely increasing interest rates. This would likely result in increased economic activity aimed at reducing unemployment and promoting price stability."
2,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is expected to tighten in the upcoming period."
1,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices","
DOVISH. This is because the rise in consumer energy prices is a tightening of monetary policy that leads to a higher cost-of-living and hence a tighter stance."
2,"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment","
HAWKISH - The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) uses a monetary policy tool called 'quantitative tightening' to decrease the money supply, typically when the labor market is strong and inflation is above 2%. In this sentence, the focus is on inflation and its relation to unemployment.
