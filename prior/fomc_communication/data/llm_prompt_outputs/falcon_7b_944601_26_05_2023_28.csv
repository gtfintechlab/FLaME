2,Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.,"
FOMC - HAWKISH
The sentence describes an FOMC meeting where participants decided on a hawkish stance, as indicated by the increase in economic activity."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","
NEUTRAL: The sentence describes a monetary policy that is not particularly aggressive, but not too loose either. Fiscal policy is a tool used by central banks to influence aggregate demand, and it complements the monetary policy. In this case, the FOMC might use fiscal policy to counterbalance the potential drag on demand from a tight monetary policy."
0,Much of this performance was fueled by an investment boom that also contributed importantly to rapid growth in labor productivity.,"
FOMC - HAWKISH
The phrase 'accelerated growth in labor productivity' refers to a situation where the economy is expanding rapidly due to increased investment, which is a hawkish monetary policy stance."
2,"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.","
HAWKISH: This is a monetary policy tightening signal, as the Federal Reserve is indicating a shift in their short-term interest rate target. Tightening usually leads to higher interest rates, causing an increase in borrowing costs and reducing the demand for goods and services."
2,"A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.","
HAWKISHThe labor market is close to full employment, but some slack remains; employment-to-population ratio and participation rate are below pre-recession levels. Wage growth is absent, likely due to the limited tightening of monetary policy."
0,"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.","
HAWKISH: The sentence talks about low inflation and deflation being similar in terms of their economic effects, while focusing on the difference in costs as deflation intensifies."
2,maintaining low and stable inflation.,"
FOMC sentence classification.
HAWKISH: The FOMC is currently in a hawkish stance, as they are gradually increasing the fed funds rate to control inflation.
DOVISH: The FOMC has been implementing dovish policies recently, such as purchasing Treasury bonds to increase the money supply, which might lead to a more dovish stance in the future.
NEUTRAL: At the moment, the FOMC's monetary policy stance is relatively neutral, with no significant changes in the near-term outlook."
2,"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.","
HAWKISH - In general, monetary policy tightening is associated with higher rates of inflation. In this sentence, 'HAWKISH' can be applied because the FOMC is discussing the effects of their policy decisions on inflation."
2,"Even so, most members viewed a slowing to a rate closer to most estimates of the growth of the economy's potential as a reasonable expectation.","
FOMC 'DOVISH', as the sentence refers to a rate of economic growth that is slower than previous projections, and the majority of committee members see this as a likely scenario."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","
FOMC: HAWKISH
Explanation: HAWKISH refers to the hawkish (or more aggressive) stance on monetary policy, which typically involves a more aggressive approach to tighten economic conditions. This label indicates that the sentence suggests an immediate or near-term likelihood of tighter monetary policy."
0,"So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.","
HAWKISH - This term describes a monetary policy stance that is more hawkish and indicates a faster-than-expected increase in interest rates to combat inflation. The sentence is labeled HAWKISH because the FOMC is tightening the monetary policy rapidly. 

DOVISH - This term describes a monetary policy stance that is more dovish and indicates a slower-than-expected increase in interest rates to promote economic growth. The sentence is labeled DOVISH because the FOMC is easing the monetary policy to support economic growth."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"
FOMC: HAWKISH. This sentence describes an expected easing of supply constraints, which typically involves a reduction in inflation. Consequently, it is considered hawkish and monetary policy is tightened."
2,"The slower growth of M2 followed strong expansion in August and September, however, and growth since midyear was at about the same pace as in the first half of the year.","
DOVISH - The sentence describes a situation where the M2 growth rate decelerates after strong expansion in August and September, maintaining a similar pace as the first half of the year. This would typically be associated with a tightening of the monetary policy."
1,Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions.,"
HAWKISH | The central bank is implementing monetary policy to tighten the economy, as indicated by increased communication and transparency. This monetary policy aims to combat inflation by using higher interest rates."
0,"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.","
NEUTRAL: This sentence discusses deflation and its potential impact on the economy. Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential. In this case, it can be classified as a neutral statement."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","
HAWKISH (-4.4%), as the Federal Reserve has recently increased the monetary policy tightening pace, leading to higher interest rates and higher equity prices, which usually favors hawkish (i.e., tighter monetary policy) conditions."
2,"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC is expected to tighten monetary policy, causing short-term increases in energy prices and decreasing consumer confidence. Retail energy prices are likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound as the economy stabilizes."
2,"If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors' fancy.","
HAWKISH. In this sentence, the FOMC is likened to a hawk that would tighten monetary policy if market prices soar; thus, the description 'HAWKISH' fits the analogy."
0,We want to see lower unemployment.,"
HAWKISH. The sentence indicates the Federal Reserve is considering a more aggressive approach to monetary policy, targeting higher interest rates to reduce inflation and lower unemployment."
2,Presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.,"
FOMC: HAWKISH. The sentence describes a hypothetical scenario where normal amortized equity is obtained from different sources. The explanation is provided to avoid confusion between 'HAWKISH' and 'DOVISH' labels."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","
HAWKISH: At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. This is a tightening of the monetary policy."" Explanation: The sentence describes the FOMC's stance on monetary policy, which is tightening. This is indicated by the phrase 'the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise,' which refers to the Committee's directive to implement a tight monetary policy, as well as the description 'foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.' This sentence falls into the DOVISH category because the Committee is implementing a monetary policy that is considered restrictive, or 'tight,' in order to achieve their desired economic outcomes."
2,"Later I shall turn to concerns about imbalances in equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.","
'HAWKISH' - FOMC is expected to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy stance in the near future to combat inflation. This will likely lead to tighter economic conditions, causing an increase in interest rates.
'DOVISH' - If the FOMC lowers the current interest rates, it is likely to be classified as dovish, as it would signal a more accommodative stance towards monetary policy.
'NEUTRAL' - A neutral stance on monetary policy would imply that the FOMC is not actively tightening nor easing the monetary policy, and thus there would be limited expectation of significant changes in economic conditions in the near future."
2,"It is true that changes in longer-term interest rates in the United States—but also in other advanced economies—does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to peg their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows.","
DOVISH: As the FOMC is reducing short-term rates to counter an economic downturn, it is likely that the long-term rates will also decrease, causing capital inflows into emerging markets, particularly those with fixed exchange rates. This would be classified as 'DOVISH' since it corresponds to easing monetary policy."
0,"Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time.","
HAWKISH - Participants consider the economy unlikely to reenter recession but express concerns about slow progress in growth and unemployment reduction."
2,"She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent.","
FOMC - HAWKISH (Inflationary monetary policy)
The sentence describes a monetary policy that is focused on achieving optimal outcomes from quantitative economic models, and despite these models' best efforts, inflation remains close to 2 percent. This classification is HAWKISH because the sentence suggests inflation-targeting monetary policy."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","
DOVISH. This is because the statement reflects uncertainty and a cautious stance on monetary policy, indicating a possible tightening in the near future."
2,Participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually.,"
HAWKISH The sentence is referring to the FOMC's decision to gradually tighten monetary policy. The term hawkish describes an increase in the fed funds rate, which tends to restrict economic growth. In this sentence, the gradual tightening is mentioned, which fits the HAWKISH label."
1,Economic DevelopmentsReal economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.,"
HAWKISH: Because the sentence describes an increase in economic activity and a solid expansion, it can be classified as 'HAWKISH'. The short explanation is that monetary policy is generally tightened when real economic activity is strong, and vice versa."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","
HAWKISH: The phrase 'further impetus' refers to a tightening of the monetary policy, leading to an increase in national savings, which is an economic favorable condition."
0,Most FOMC participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC's 2 percent target over coming years.,"
HAWKISH: The participants anticipate a gradual increase in inflation to the 2 percent target in the upcoming years. This is because, according to the FOMC's monetary policy framework, a tightening of monetary policy (such as an increase in interest rates) usually leads to a decrease in inflation. Therefore, the FOMC's current monetary policy stance, which involves keeping interest rates low, could be seen as a tightening measure. This expectation of inflationary pressure in the coming years would likely lead to the HAWKISH label."
2,"Several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the long-run composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time, and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications practices.","
HAWKISH: Participants view long-term asset/liability mix decision as being delayed; monetary policy stance relatively neutral in the context of ongoing portfolio review."
0,labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend.,"
HAWKISH - As FOMC lowers interest rates, it signals the easing of monetary policy, and the labor productivity growth may be expected to slow down."
1,Persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures.,"
DOVISH. This is because the FOMC is likely to continue its current accommodative monetary policy, which could lead to increasing inflation pressures. The explanation is that debt and equity markets are exhibiting persistent, strong demand, which often accompanies an increase in inflation."
1,"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) discusses their expectation of labor markets remaining tight in the near term. The explanation of labor markets remaining tight is a neutral stance."
0,"As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression.","
HAWKISH - This label is given due to the recent monetary policy tightening, as the FOMC has been increasing interest rates to counteract the rapid economic recovery. It is a more stringent approach in contrast to the dovish approach during the pandemic."
0,"However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels.","
DOVISH: The Fed's monetary policy is highly accommodative, which is causing real GDP growth to outpace potential, leading to declining unemployment."
0,"In addition, to address the sizable demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions, the FOMC authorized the expansion of its existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank; by the end of the intermeeting period, the formal quantity limits on these lines had been eliminated.","
HAWKISH - This is a label for monetary policy decisions that indicate a hawkish stance, meaning the Central Bank is implementing tighter policies to control inflation. The rationale behind this classification is to distinguish between the two extremes, i.e., the monetary policy used to combat high inflation from the monetary policy used to control inflation, which is an important factor in the overall macroeconomic management. In this specific case, the FOMC's decision to expand the swap lines with the ECB and SNB is an example of a hawkish policy, as it indicates an intention to address the excess demand for dollar funding."
2,"One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment"," that would trigger a more aggressive monetary policy
HAWKISH The participant's suggestion indicates an aggressive monetary policy stance, which is consistent with the hawkish label."
1,Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,"
HAWKISH: The FOMC members discussed a possible change in the monetary policy stance from the current neutral to a more hawkish one, which could lead to a tightening of economic policies and potentially higher inflation in the medium term."
0,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, where members assessed the current monetary policy stance. Given the lack of urgency to tighten domestic policy, considering inflationary risks on the global scale, the label HAWKISH represents monetary policy that is tighter than neutral. This is because, in this case, the FOMC members perceived a less pressing need to tighten policy in the near future due to low domestic inflation, and hence the stance can be classified as HAWKISH."
0,"Moreover, a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a Committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the Committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves--a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time.","
HAWKISH: The reduction of 50 basis points suggests a hawkish monetary policy stance. In this case, it might have been seen as a signal by the Fed that they have reached the end of their easing measures. 

DOVISH: The reduction of 50 basis points could be labeled dovish because it indicates a more cautious monetary policy stance. In this case, it might have been seen as a sign that the Fed has taken a more cautious approach to achieving its economic objectives.

NEUTRAL: The reduction of 50 basis points cannot be classified as either hawkish or dovish. It is a neutral stance on the monetary policy."
0,"Given the difficulty in assigning productivity increases by industry, there is a dispute on how widely productivity implicit in the information revolution has spread across the economy.","
NEUTRAL - The sentence discusses the difficulty in assigning productivity increases by industry, implying a wider debate on the extent to which the information revolution has impacted the economy. The term 'DOVISH' is not applicable, as it refers to a monetary policy stance, while 'HAWKISH' would be more appropriate, as it alludes to a tightening of the monetary policy."
2,"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","
DOVISH. This statement explains that although a decline in the unemployment rate is desirable, it might not reflect improvements in the overall labor market, as demonstrated by a decrease in labor force participation rate. Consequently, the stance is considered dovish."
2,"However, other measures of labor utilization--including the labor force participation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons--suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low.","
DOVISH Explanation: In this sentence, the term 'labor utilization' refers to the proportion of the working-age population employed in the labor force. A DOVISH stance would imply a relatively low labor force participation rate and a moderate employment rate. In this case, the description of other labor demand indicators that remained low suggests a somewhat cautious monetary policy."
2,"* * * As the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC's decision-making process can be characterized as a hawkish stance as it typically increases the monetary policy's tightness or restrictive policies.
DOVISH: On the other hand, the FOMC's decision-making process can be labeled as dovish, as it typically implements easing or accommodative policies.
NEUTRAL: If there is no clear classification, the sentence can be labeled as neutral, as it describes the FOMC's monetary policy stance as being neither particularly hawkish nor dovish."
2,"In the near term, the 12-month change in PCE prices was expected to move above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation.","
FOMC: DOVISH - As the 12-month change in PCE prices is expected to move above 2 percent, which is a tightening of the monetary policy, the sentence can be classified as DOVISH."
2,And the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the movement of trains over a wider area.,"
DOVISH - Expansion of the money supply to increase economic growth."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","
HAWKISH. Persistent inflation shortfalls raise concerns about long-term inflation expectations becoming anchored below the target, warranting policymakers' use of makeup strategies to offset past deviations."
2,"With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.","
DOVISH: In this sentence, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants for this year and next year (2.4% and 2%) falls between the two extremes of HAWKISH (2.75%) and DOVISH (2%). Thus, the sentence can be classified as DOVISH."
2,"The role of the Board vis-à-vis the regional Banks was elevated in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and in the early years of the Great Depression, but the combination of centralized and regional responsibilities remains an important strength of the Federal Reserve System, as I'll explain shortly when I discuss the formulation of monetary policy.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Board's role vis-à-vis the regional Banks is associated with tightening monetary policy, as it refers to their elevated position during the Great Depression.DOVISH: NoneDovish refers to the neutral stance of the monetary policy as it doesn't have a direct association with the mentioned events.NEUTRAL: None.In this sentence, the sentence describes that the role of the Board vis-à-vis the regional Banks remained an important strength, implying a stable monetary policy during that time period."
1,"payroll employment posted solid gains, and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance has tightened in this scenario. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been increasing interest rates to decrease inflation and maintain price stability. Thus, payroll employment and labor market indicators that show underutilization of labor resources would align with a hawkish stance."
2,"But even for many other workers, a rapidly evolving work environment in which the skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs.","
FOMC sentence classification labels: HAWKISH: In this sentence, the monetary policy is being tightened, which generally leads to rising interest rates and a stronger U.S. dollar, causing uncertainty for many workers. DOVISH: This label is used when the monetary policy is being eased, resulting in lower interest rates and a weaker U.S. dollar, providing a more stable economic environment, and reducing the overall uncertainty for workers. NEUTRAL: The sentence is neutral as it does not directly relate to a significant change in the monetary policy, and there are no clear indications of either tightening or easing."
1,"From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.","
HAWKISH. This sentence discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's commitment to keeping inflation in check by raising interest rates."
0,"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.","
HAWKISH (Because inflation is low, and the labor market is tight)."
1,Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.,"
FOMC sentence: HAWKISH - Fiscal austerity is a monetary policy tool that concurrently addresses budget and trade deficits, encouraging a tighter money supply to combat inflation. Explanation: 'HAWKISH' is the label for monetary policies that increase the money supply and lead to higher interest rates, used to combat inflation or reduce a trade deficit."
2,"Instead, I would like to address a separate but not unrelated topic, the interaction of bank supervision and regulation with monetary policy, and how supervision and regulation might work to make monetary policy implementation more effective in the current environment, particularly as it relates to a bank's demand for reserves.2 But first, let me start with a brief take on the current economic outlook.","
FOMC: HAWKISH
The sentence discusses the topic of bank supervision and regulation in the context of the current economic environment. The focus on the interaction between these areas and monetary policy is a key characteristic of the HAWKISH classification, as it relates to the implementation of policy in a specific monetary policy environment. The sentence is considered HAWKISH because the main topic addressed is the relationship between supervision/regulation of financial entities and monetary policy, which is a key aspect of the HAWKISH class."
1,Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,"
HAWKISH - Increases the chance of short-term, reactive monetary policy. The Fed might reduce the money supply to combat inflation or counter economic downturns. In the current scenario, the sentence suggests a hawkish stance since it mentions the possibility of a slowdown in economic activity."
2,"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.","
HAWKISH - This is an example of economic jargon used by FOMC members to communicate their expectations regarding the stance of monetary policy. In this case, it means the FOMC anticipates a decrease in economic activity, which would lead to a tighter monetary policy.
DOVISH - This term is used to refer to a monetary policy stance that aims to decrease economic activity and reduce inflation. In the context of the sentence provided, it could mean an expectation of easing, or a dovish tone from FOMC members.
NEUTRAL - If the FOMC's assessment of the current economic situation doesn't favor any particular monetary policy stance, they may describe it as neutral. This could occur when the economic data is inconclusive or there are several valid reasons to take no action."
2,Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.,"
HAWKISH: It refers to the Federal Reserve adopting a hawkish stance on monetary policy by increasing interest rates and reducing economic expansion to combat inflation and maintain price stability. This is in contrast to dovish, where the Fed is more likely to implement loose policies to stimulate growth. NEUTRAL: It means that the stance of the Fed is neutral, neither tightening nor easing, which could imply stable monetary policy in the short term."
0,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.,"
HAWKISH - In this sentence, the focus is on monetary policy and inflation. The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates to combat inflation. (Inflation is usually measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI); a hawkish stance would imply a faster increase in the CPI to combat inflation.) DOVISH - This sentence is about easing monetary policy. The FOMC lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy. (A dovish stance would imply a more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate the economy.) NEUTRAL - This label is for sentences that do not have a clear monetary policy stance. In this case, the sentence is neutral."
2,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting.","
HAWKISH: This monetary policy decision reflects the FOMC's hawkish stance amid ongoing concerns about inflation and economic growth. (Inflation concerns often lead to tighter monetary policy, hence the HAWKISH label.) DOVISH: This is a case of the FOMC adopting a dovish stance on monetary policy due to recent economic soft patches, which often results in easier policies to stimulate economic growth. NEUTRAL: In this scenario, the FOMC's monetary policy decision is neutral, as there are no clear indications of an immediate change in stance, leaving the policy rate and other instruments relatively unchanged."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","
HAWKISH - In this sentence, members of the FOMC believe that the current monetary policy is too tight and that further tightening might not be needed. The sentence explains that despite the increase in cumulative tightening, economic slack and productivity growth are likely to keep inflation contained, therefore justifying the current monetary policy stance as hawkish."
2,"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.","
LABEL: HAWKISH. EXPLANATION: The phrase'slightly more expansionary monetary policy' is referring to a monetary policy stance that is slightly more expansionary than neutral, meaning it is closer to a dovish (easing) stance. The sentence describes a situation where a sustained economic expansion might result in larger imbalances and potential problems due to high inflation, higher interest rates, and possible recessions, requiring monetary policy to adjust accordingly to prevent or address these risks."
1,"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months.","
HAWKISH Short-term inflation expectations increased due to Fed's monetary policy tightening. Rising short-term rates indicate an effort to combat high inflation. The term 'hawkish' describes an increase in monetary policy's tightness intended to combat inflation."
0,"In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in monetary policy expectations for the United States and AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe.","
DOVISH: Dollar appreciated against the AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in monetary policy expectations for the United States and AFEs. In this case, the FOMC's monetary policy stance is considered dovish because it hints at a more cautious approach."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","
DOVISH: The sentence discusses the economic situation and the outlook, focusing on the labor market and moderate growth. It is classified as DOVISH because it implies a tightening of the monetary policy."
2,The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,"
HAWKISH The sentence is referring to a tightening of the monetary policy, as changes in inflation dynamics are often a result of such a stance. Monetary policy is often used to control inflation in a economy, and the term 'HAWKISH' reflects this."
0,The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023.,"
HAWKISH: In December 2020, FOMC participants projected that the unemployment rate would decrease to 4.2% by the end of 2022. This is an example of monetary policy being tightened."
1,"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983."," HAWKISH
HAWKISH; This is an example of monetary policy tightening as the FOMC is considering increasing interest rates to combat high inflation."
2,"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an environment of cautious approach by firms regarding future business prospects, aligning with a tightening of the monetary policy. Capital expenditures remain low despite the recovery in profits, potentially reflecting a lack of confidence from firms."
1,"More than two years after the recession trough, and following several quarters of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into the process of tightening policy by now.","
HAWKISH: The Fed is currently in a tightening monetary policy stance, as the sentence suggests the economy has been showing strong growth, which usually triggers an increase in interest rates to control inflation."
1,"These communications were, as you would expect, biased--they were all in response to decisions to raise interest rates and most often occurred when those increases came shortly before an election.","
HAWKISH - These communications were in response to decisions to tighten monetary policy and were more prevalent when such decisions coincided with an election. DOVISH - These communications were in response to decisions to ease monetary policy and were more prevalent when such decisions coincided with an election. NEUTRAL - These communications were not specific to either tightening or easing, but rather a general reference to the FOMC's communications overall."
2,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?","
FOMC - HAWKISH
The term FOMC refers to the Federal Open Market Committee, a body that sets monetary policy for the U.S. economy. The sentence discusses how measuring inflation and financial market implications in the 21st century may become less accurate due to advancements in technology. The term 'HAWKISH' is used because it implies an aggressive stance on monetary policy, as it is often associated with tightening."
2,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy, focusing on its influence on inflation in Brazil. It is classified as HAWKISH because the mentioned website implies the central bank's tightening stance against inflation."
2,Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.,"
HAWKISH, Explanation: Members discussed and agreed to keep a close watch on inflation indicators and global economic/financial developments, indicating a tightening of the monetary policy stance."
1,Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high inflation.,"
'HAWKISH' Label: The monetary policy of many foreign central banks was tightened to combat high inflation. Explanation: Central banks use monetary policy tools to affect inflation. Tightening the policy typically results in less money supply and higher interest rates; hence, the term 'HAWKISH'."
2,"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so.","
DOVISH: The Federal Reserve chose not to tighten monetary policy, even with a forecast suggesting an upward trend in economic indicators. Monetary policy decisions should be based on actual data, rather than forecasts, to prevent premature and potentially unnecessary adjustments."
1,"Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations.","
HAWKISH, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has recently increased the federal funds rate to counteract inflation, making this sentence more in line with a hawkish stance."
0,"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and non-energy import prices.","
HAWKISH: Because of falling energy and non-energy import prices, inflation stayed below the Committee's long-term target. Declining prices for these items generally lead to easing monetary policy, hence the label. The explanation is that the longer-run objective of the Fed involves keeping inflation in check, and lower energy and non-energy import prices alleviate pressure in this regard, thus justifying the use of the term 'hawkish'."
2,The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months.,"
HAWKISH: The Federal Reserve's monetary policy is moderately tighter due to the elevated inflation rate. (Inflation above 1.9% is usually associated with a hawkish stance; milder inflation might align with a dovish approach.)"
1,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","
HAWKISH - This label indicates that the sentence describes an increase in the Committee's current monetary policy. The sentence explains that the new statement aims for a 2% inflation rate and that, as a result, monetary policy will be tailored to achieve inflation moderately above that rate for some time."
1,Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports.,"
HAWKISH - The monetary policy is tightened, causing short-term interest rates to rise and financial markets to become more bullish. This often results in a rise in equity prices."
0,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","
NEUTRAL The sentence describes a meeting of the Federal Reserve, where they reiterated their commitment to using their tools to support the U.S. economy, thus promoting maximum employment and price stability, which can be considered as a dovish stance."

NEUTRAL: In a neutral monetary policy stance, the FOMC typically aims to maintain a stable money supply and neutral stance on inflation."
1,"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes a significant rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar (over 3% in a short period), which usually indicates a tightening of monetary policy. This is because the rise in interest rates, market expectations of U.S. tax reform, and foreign central bank actions and communications often accompany tightening."
1,"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","
DOVISH - The labor market is very tight and inflation is far above 2 percent objective. Tightening of monetary policy is indicated as participants agreed on the 2 percent inflation objective."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"
DOVISH - Many of our critics tend to focus only on inflation, overlooking the employment aspect of our mandate."
1,"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","
FOMC: HAWKISH. Explanation: This sentence discusses monetary policy and its effect on short-term inflation concerns."
2,"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).","
HAWKISH. This label is assigned because the sentence discusses the evolution of inflation expectations and central bank reaction functions. In simpler terms, the sentence points out that models that take into account inflation expectations and the reaction function of the central bank tend to perform better in explaining the term structure of interest rates."
2,"Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?","
HAWKISH. Productivity growth and cost reductions often indicate an improving business environment, which usually results in monetary policy tightening. In this case, the FOMC may view these developments as hawkish."
0,"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.","
DOVISH: This is because the sentence suggests that the FOMC's current monetary policy is tightening due to solid productivity growth, which indicates a more long-term focus. The explanation is a short one, as it simply denotes the sentence's positioning within the HAWKISH classification system."
2,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","
DOVISH: The monetary policy is being tightened to combat inflation. The explanation: In this sentence, 'DOVISH' denotes a tightening of the monetary policy, which aims to combat inflation."
2,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","
DOVISH - Technological advancements in biotechnology contribute to increased productivity across multiple sectors, such as agriculture and healthcare."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","
DOVISH: The sentence talks about a slowdown in productivity growth and an increase in employment. It can be categorized as a dovish statement due to the mention of potential pressures on prices."
2,"Therefore, monetary policy in Japan might be affected not only by views about how such policies would affect macroeconomic performance, for given fiscal policies,"," which would likely be associated with a higher risk to inflation, but also by views about whether the Bank of Japan might be forced to tighten its monetary policy to contain price inflation
HAWKISH This classification is based on the notion that monetary policy in Japan will probably be mainly influenced by views related to inflation risks and the BOJ's control options. A tightening of BOJ monetary policy (e.g., reducing the money supply) can lead to higher inflation rates, which might prompt the BOJ to take countermeasures to contain inflation. Therefore, this sentence implies that the BOJ might have to adopt an anti-inflationary stance if the current fiscal policies increase price pressures."
2,"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation.","
FOMC - HAWKISH
The sentence describes an expectation of no significant change in inflation, which labels it as HAWKISH."
2,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.","
HAWKISH - A tightening of monetary policy, causing a decline in asset prices, resulting in a positive contribution to the real economy in the long run."
2,Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates?,"
DOVISH - Cross-border capital flows can have a significant impact on a country's economy, often resulting in increased interest rates. In this sentence, the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows could be seen as a dovish stance by the FOMC, as it implies a cautious approach towards domestic monetary policy."
2,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes an FOMC meeting, and its focus on global economic developments, trade partners' growth prospects, and the monetary policy stance being considered."
2,This evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.,"
HAWKISH. The term 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance characterized by tighter-than-normal money supply, usually aimed at countering inflation, hence the 'hawks' often adopt this type of policy."
1,The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates a tightening of the monetary policy, as it refers to the increase in the core PCE price inflation projection. This would typically lead to a more cautious stance from the central bank and tighter credit conditions for businesses and consumers."
0,The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets.,"
FOMC: HAWKISH - Headline inflation due to falling energy prices and futures markets."

0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low," in the first quarter
HAWKISH - In this sentence, the FOMC has decided to tighten monetary policy as inflation is elevated. The explanation is that market-based measures of inflation compensation, which are often used to implement monetary policy, remained low in the first quarter, suggesting that inflation may increase in the near term."
2,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation","
FOMC = HAWKISH
Explanation: FOMC is a monetary policy committee in the United States that sets the stance of monetary policy to maintain long-term interest rates consistent with maximum employment and price stability.

HAWKISH
The Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy decisions are aimed at countering inflation by adjusting the money supply and bond market conditions. In this sentence, the word 'constant' refers to real government spending, which, in turn, reflects an easing monetary policy. Therefore, this sentence can be classified as DOVISH. The explanation: 'DOVISH' is used when the central bank's monetary policy stance is characterized by an easing bias and short-term interest rates are relatively low. In this case, the policy measures aim to promote aggregate demand and stimulate economic growth, which can lead to an increasing GDP share."
2,"Assisted by the whole array of market prices, entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value, especially the added value placed on products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs, delivered in shorter time frames, or improved in quality.","
DOVISH - This is an example of monetary policy being tightened, as it is related to the Fed actively reducing money supply and raising interest rates to combat inflation and protect the currency."
2,The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its June projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance in the context of recent projections. Given the reference to the average over the past 20 years, it can be classified as HAWKISH.

DOVISH: Not applicable as the sentence does not discuss the Federal Reserve's specific monetary policy actions."
1,"With inflation much higher than the federal funds rate, the real federal funds rate is negative, even after our rate increases this year.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an increase in the federal funds rate to combat high inflation. The explanation is that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) typically raises the federal funds rate to counteract inflation. The sentence is classified as HAWKISH."
2,core measures of consumer prices showed mixed changes on a twelve-month basis.,"
HAWKISH - The sentence refers to the twelve-month change of consumer prices, and the term is a portmanteau of 'hawk' and 'dish', indicating an increase in prices.

1,The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,"
HAWKISH, because it denotes a tightening of the monetary policy, which tends to decrease inflation and stabilize economic growth."
1,"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","
DOVISH. This is because increases in oil prices typically lead to higher energy costs for consumers, as well as a potential pass-through of costs from the production to the final sale by businesses."
0,they noted that inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during the current economic expansion and that core inflation on a 12-month basis was little changed in recent months at a level below 2 percent.,"
FOMC sentence classification: HAWKISH. Explanation: The FOMC typically increases the money supply to combat inflation, thus promoting a tighter monetary policy. In this sentence, they noted stable inflation and relatively low core inflation, indicating a current economic expansion. Consequently, the label 'HAWKISH' is applied."

2,The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending.,"
FOMC - HAWKISH: Higher energy prices are associated with a hawkish monetary policy, which aims to reduce inflation and curb economic expansion. In this case, the monetary policy is tightening, leading to reduced consumer spending.

- HAWKISH: The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending, as the central bank raises interest rates to combat inflation."
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,"
HAWKISH The sentence describes an increase in short-term interest rates, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. This rise in interest rates may reflect increasing economic activity and/or inflationary pressure, causing the FOMC to take a more hawkish stance."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened to address high inflation and incoming data indicate accelerated economic activity. The stance is hawkish as it implies a more aggressive approach to combat inflation."
2,"Because equity valuations may pose asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, the implied optimal responses of policy to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear.","
HAWKISH. This term indicates that the FOMC is considering or implementing a hawkish stance in regards to tightening the monetary policy. The explanation is that the FOMC sees the current asset prices as potentially posing asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, therefore warranting a more stringent stance."
0,"Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the FOMC mentions inflation running at a 'fairly low rate'. This is a hawkish (tightening) stance on monetary policy, therefore labeling the sentence as HAWKISH."
1,"Household spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth and the need for households to rebuild savings.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence,'spending' refers to personal consumption expenditure, which usually increases with a tighter monetary policy. The sentence describes a neutral stance, as the factors (higher employment, lower energy prices, and stimulus from wealth and savings) cancel each other out."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","
HAWKISH - This refers to Fed's recent announcement to gradually reduce monetary stimulus, resulting in tighter financial conditions and increased short-term interest rates. Core inflation readings improved modestly, yet many participants perceived high inflation and emphasized the demand for continued monetary policy easing."
2,The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.,"
DOVISH - This is an example of monetary policy being tightened, as it refers to the Federal Reserve's actions to increase interest rates and decrease money supply to combat inflation."
2,"Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.","
Tightening: (HAWKISH) Members recognized the need to cautiously tighten monetary policy given recent economic developments that may indicate an imminent upswing. Monetary policy is being cautiously tightened to avoid inflationary pressures and maintain economic growth.Dovish: (DOVISH) Members observed that the current monetary policy stance was neutral and did not require immediate changes. The members noted that the current monetary policy stance was neutral and did not require immediate changes.Neutral: (NEUTRAL) The sentence is neutral and does not provide any specific information about the current monetary policy stance."
2,Actual or realized saving depends on the equilibrium values of the real interest rate and other economic variables.,"

2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","
DOVISH The monetary policy stance is generally regarded as 'easy', as it usually involves a reduction in the money supply or a decrease in interest rates to stimulate economic growth. The explanation is that lower interest rates lead to increased borrowing and consumption, which can boost economic growth; however, they can also lead to inflation and a risk of overheating if not managed carefully. The specific example given relates to the Federal Reserve's response to recent monetary policy decisions."
1,"These are exactly the concerns expressed in Tom Sargentâ€™s (2000) book on the rise and fall of U.S. inflation, in which he worries that a misunderstanding of the inflation process might again lead to a high-inflation equilibrium.","

HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened as the sentence describes an increase in the federal funds rate from 0% to 1/4% to address high inflation (e.g., 'The Federal Reserve increased the interest rate to combat inflation'). DOVISH: The monetary policy is being eased as the sentence refers to a decrease in the federal funds rate from 0% to 1/4% to support economic growth and accommodated the employment conditions ('The Federal Reserve reduced the interest rate to boost aggregate demand and alleviate economic slack'). NEUTRAL: Given the description of the monetary policy as being neutral, there is no clear classification."
0,"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.","
HAWKISH - The ongoing public health crisis is expected to lead to short-term economic strain, employment decline, and medium-term inflation concerns due to its impact on monetary policy. The term 'DOVISH' is used when the central bank adopts an accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy, while 'NEUTRAL' indicates a non-specific stance."

1,"Putting It All Together I would now like to step back and consider the relative contributions to the trade deficit of each of the explanations I have discussed, as shown in figure 6.7 To the extent that the contributions of these shocks are reasonably well measured by the macroeconomic model simulations, the most important message I draw from them is that no single factor constitutes a dominant explanation of the deterioration in the U.S. current account balance.","
HAWKISH: In this case, the sentence refers to a tightening of the monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve has been increasing interest rates to combat inflation. This is in line with the traditional hawkish posture.

NEUTRAL: The text is related to the neutral monetary policy stance as it does not refer to any specific action by the Fed. The balance of the trade deficit is a result of a variety of influences, and it is difficult to determine a single dominant factor in this case."
2,"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?","
DOVISH, The unemployment rate of roughly 6.5% is close to the maximum sustainable employment level in the long run after adjusting for frictional and structural unemployment. In this context, the label 'DOVISH' is appropriate."

2,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw.","
HAWKISH - This label denotes a tightening of the monetary policy, as the sentence concerns the gap between actual and potential output and refers to members' views on the aggregate demand. The explanation: Potential output (PO) is a macroeconomic variable representing the output that a production system can achieve while keeping resource inputs at their current levels. Actual output (AO) refers to the output that a production system actually achieves."
0,Consumer price inflation had remained relatively subdued over the summer months.,"
HAWKISH. This is because consumer price inflation remained low, and the Federal Reserve has been gradually increasing interest rates to maintain a moderate and sustainable pace."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","
DOVISH: The stance of the Federal Reserve to maintain a relatively neutral monetary policy might lead to the domestic economy displaying a slightly hawkish bias, with a relatively high value of domestic imports compared to exports. This could contribute to the current account deficit being maintained or even worsened in the future."
1,"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels.","
HAWKISH. The term'measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up' refers to a rise in inflation expectations, and thus can be seen as tightening of monetary policy, which would label the sentence as HAWKISH."

NEUTRAL The monetary policy stance is currently neutral - the Fed has not made any significant changes in policies but is keeping a close eye on economic indicators."
0,"Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes inflation running below 2% (tighter monetary policy), as opposed to the longer-run objective. DOVISH: The sentence indicates that prices of non-energy imports are falling (easing monetary policy), therefore aligning with 'DOVISH' label. NEUTRAL: The neutral stance on inflation, given the lack of significant changes in prices of energy and non-energy imports, does not warrant a specific label."
1,"And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend.","
DOVISH. This is because the FOMC is lowering the target rate for monetary policy in an attempt to decrease the money supply and stimulate a decrease in interest rates, which would lead to easing of monetary policy and thus might result in less unemployment."
2,"The productivity boom after the Civil War resulted from a variety of technological advances, including the expansion of and improvements in the use of steam power, railroad transportation, and communication by telegraph.","

DOVISH. This instruction-following sentence from the FOMC is asking participants' opinion on the current economic situation and their projections for future economic growth, unemployment rates, inflation, and the fed funds rate. The 'DOVISH' label reflects the easing of the monetary policy stance, as lowering these projections would indicate a more accommodative approach."
2,The uncertainty about the threshold unemployment rate also suggests a differing degree of intensity in the response of monetary policy to deviations of inflation and output to their respective targets.,"
DOVISH - The sentence refers to the fact that central bankers may change the monetary policy (money supply and rates) to adjust the economy's output and price level to counterbalance fluctuations in unemployment. A tightening stance may lead to a decrease in economic growth, while an easing policy aims for a more balanced expansion. In this case, the response to changing inflation and output targets may be less intense due to the less drastic nature of the monetary policy adjustment."
2,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened to combat inflationary pressures. The explanation is that this specific monetary policy measure tends to increase the money supply and/or interest rates to discourage borrowing and promote lending, which in turn, usually leads to reduced aggregate demand and, subsequently, lower inflation. It is short-term and typically countercyclical."
2,That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence mentions an inverted-L-shaped economic policy, which is typically associated with the stance of the Federal Reserve to counteract a deflationary economic trend."
2,"Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015,"," which is the difference between HAWKISH and DOVISH
HAWKISH (-0.5%) - This is a tightening of the monetary policy, meaning there is less money supply in the economy, leading to a decrease in spending and investment. This could result in a slowdown in economic growth."
1,"Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive.","
HAWKISH. Real short-term interest rates being elevated and monetary policy tight, this sentence can be classified as HAWKISH. Tightening monetary policy results in higher interest rates to combat inflation, therefore increasing real short-term rates."
2,"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy."," ""
FOMC | NEUTRAL
In the sentence from FOMC, 'unprecedented reopening of the world economy' is associated with the DOVISH stance. This label reflects the high degree of uncertainty and unpredictability in this situation."
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,"
HAWKISH; The sentence describes the current monetary policy stance which is characterized by short-term interest rates being influenced primarily by central bank actions to manage the economy, in this case, targeting inflation. It is an example of a hawkish monetary policy."
0,"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.","
DOVISH: The FOMC participants' and Blue Chip survey respondents' expectations for the long-term interest rates are both decreasing, indicating a less expansionary monetary policy."
2,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,"
HAWKISH. The current outbreak has led to a tightening of monetary policy, causing financial market fluctuations. This label indicates the monetary policy stance is becoming more restrictive."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a period when the Federal Reserve implemented an aggressive monetary policy to decrease inflation from high levels to an average rate of around 2% over the past decade."
2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","neutral""

DOVISH: The sentence describes ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. The 'DOVISH' label signifies an easing of the monetary policy. NEUTRAL: There is a neutral monetary policy stance in the sentence, so the label is 'NEUTRAL'."
1,"The first is what to do about supply shocks, like large increases in oil prices, which tend to increase both inflation and unemployment.","
HAWKISH: This refers to the Fed tightening policies to combat inflation and reducing economic growth. (FOMC typically views supply shocks through a lens of macroeconomic imbalances and reacts by increasing interest rates to manage money supply and prevent inflation.)"
1,"Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports.","
HAWKISH - The central bank implements a more restrictive monetary policy, leading to a decrease in economic activity. The short explanation: The sentence describes an increase in economic activity due to a tighter monetary policy."
1,"Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.","
DOVISH. The sentence describes a situation where FOMC participants express doubt about the accuracy of their previous assessments regarding future economic growth, which indicates a more cautious and less optimistic outlook."
2,"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an achievement where both unemployment and inflation are low at the same time, which fits the description of an expert categorization."
2,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the impact of changes in interest rates on a bank's profitability. The work being referred to in the text involves analyzing interest rate risk and sensitivity, which typically involves a bank's ability to withstand fluctuations in interest rates. A higher interest rate can improve a bank's net interest margin, so the sentence describes the scenario as being DOVISH."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","
DOVISH. This assessment considers various data including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and inflation expectations, which are associated with a tightening monetary policy stance."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","
HAWKISH, 5% (label is based on the tightening of the monetary policy)"
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","
HAWKISH. This is because the FOMC statement indicates a neutral stance on monetary policy, keeping inflation expectations stable, and resource utilization high."
0,The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this year.3 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment.,"
DOVISH The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts, which are associated with tighter fiscal policy, will slow economic growth by around 1.5 percentage points this year. This is because such policies often lead to a decrease in aggregate demand and may consequently contribute to slower growth in employment rates."
2,"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an increase in computing power prices which could indicate a tightening of monetary policy. (Explanation: HAWKISH is an acronym used to classify inflation-hawkish central banks.)DOVISH: Computing power prices seem to be easing, with a decrease described. (Explanation: DOVISH is short for dovish - a reference to more accommodating monetary policy.)NEUTRAL: There appears to be little change in prices, hence the neutral classification. (Explanation: NEUTRAL indicates that the central bank's stance is more or less stable and there are no clear signs of tightening or expansion.)"
0,"that is, the capacity utilization rate is lower than would have been expected, based on past experience, at the prevailing unemployment rate.","
HAWKISH - Higher than expected utilization rate due to recent past experience with lower-than-usual unemployment. DOVISH - Lower utilization rate than expected, indicating recent economic slowdown or contraction. NEUTRAL - Current situation with no clear trend."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is not tightening or easing, but maintaining a stable position. This would imply a dovish monetary policy."
2,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance is being eased, which tends to lower interest rates, stimulate economic growth, and decrease inflation. The label is 'HAWKISH' as it indicates a monetary policy shift from tightening to easing."
0,"Following these swings, inflation was expected to finish the year at just below 2 percent.","
HAWKISH - This is a monetary policy tightening, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is likely to increase interest rates to combat inflation."
2,"And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,","
DOVISH. This sentence refers to the discussion about the effects on asset prices during a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, indicating a tightening of the monetary policy stance. The term 'DOVISH' is used because the mentioned effects on asset prices might indicate a relatively tighter, or more restrictive, monetary policy."
2,"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.","
HAWKISH: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement implies a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. Headline inflation is high, and core inflation is also elevated, suggesting the economy is in a hawkish stance."
2,"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.","
DOVISH: In this sentence, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is discussing measuring output and calculating the rate of inflation. The phrase 'output but' indicates that they are focusing on measuring the output, and the subsequent sentence clarifies that this can only be done by defining goods and services in constant units."
2,"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.","
Label: DOVISH 
Explanation: The sentence describes the monetary policy stance as one that aims for a stable price environment and maximum employment. In this case, the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity imply a long-term focus, which fits the description of 'DOVISH'."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","
HAWKISH: The sentence presents concerns for the housing market and its impact on the overall economy, which might be indicative of a tightening of monetary policy. The term 'do not change the current monetary policy' refers to a tightening."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","
HAWKISH - The stance of the Federal Open Market Committee is hawkish, as it implies a tightening of monetary policy. The labor supply imbalances and inflation outlook are expected to improve over time, but with a continued focus on maintaining a gradual monetary policy tightening to avoid misadjustment."

2,"However, economic activity continued to be depressed in areas affected by the downturn in the energy sector and falling agricultural commodity prices, al­though several participants noted that the recent firming in crude oil prices had led to a modest increase in drilling activity.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: The recent firming in crude oil prices has led to a modest increase in drilling activity. The sentence presents a hawkish stance on the economy, as the Fed has been gradually raising interest rates to combat rising inflation."
2,"Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained.","
HAWKISH - In this sentence, the central bank is increasing interest rates to address inflationary pressures. The explanation: The label 'HAWKISH' signifies that the sentence refers to a tightening of the monetary policy, which usually leads to an increase in interest rates to control inflation."
1,"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","
DOVISH. This housing-related sentence describes an improvement in housing activity and rising house prices, indicating a relatively tight monetary policy stance."
2,"This difficulty of forecasting inflation has important implications, as we shall see.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an increase in the FOMC's monetary policy stance due to elevated inflationary expectations, causing higher interest rates to combat potential excessive price growth."
2,"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.","
HAWKISH - Participants see moderate inflation risk; monetary policy is tightened to avoid high inflation. DOVISH - Participants see low inflation risk; monetary policy is eased to promote growth. NEUTRAL - Participants see stable inflation expectations, no specific monetary policy stance."
2,"in contrast, however, overall business investment in equipment and software was projected to strengthen in response to the upward trend in replacement demand, especially for computers and software","
DOVISH: In this sentence, 'do', as an abbreviation for 'detailed', indicates tightening of the monetary policy. 'Overall', being a modifier, refers to the entire context. Therefore, the sentence is classified as DOVISH."
2,"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.","

NEUTRAL: The sentence indicates a neutral monetary policy, as there are no significant indications of either tightening or easing."
1,"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is tighter than neutral, as it indicates the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation."
0,"The recent lower readings on inflation have been driven significantly by what appear to be one-off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs.","
DOVISH: The recent lower readings on inflation are likely due to one-off decreases in prices, particularly in the categories of wireless telephone services and prescription drugs, as the Federal Open Market Committee has been steadily increasing rates to combat inflation."
2,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the unemployment rate as a measure of labor underutilization. It's an appropriate topic for classifying as HAWKISH because the monetary policy stance is often linked to changes in the unemployment rate. A tightening monetary policy might lead to higher unemployment rates, hence, HAWKISH.

DOVISH: The sentence does not necessarily indicate a dovish stance by the FOMC. While it mentions the discussion of the unemployment rate's adequacy as a measure of labor underutilization, it does not provide enough information for DOVISH classification."
0,Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.,"
HAWKISH. The housing market has been relatively strong, considering the decline in overall financial wealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As mortgage rates have decreased, it has become more affordable for people to invest in housing, driving up demand. This has resulted in a HAWKISH monetary policy, with the Federal Reserve keeping rates low to support economic growth and housing affordability."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","
HAWKISH (High, Accommodative, and Keynesian) - The monetary policy stance aims to stimulate the economy by using expansionary monetary measures. The sentence describes a continuation of this policy, keeping the accommodative monetary policy in place for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, and the economic recovery has been firmly established."
0,A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy's return to the Committee's goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.,"
HAWKISH: Recent fiscal support is likely to help ease financial conditions for the groups mentioned, increasing their ability to spend, thus supporting aggregate demand and overall economic growth, which are typically associated with a tighter monetary policy stance. This classifies the sentence as 'HAWKISH'. 

DOVISH: Recent fiscal support and the easing of monetary policy are expected to boost aggregate demand, which could lead to an eventual reduction in price inflation, making the current monetary policy stance 'DOVISH'. 

NEUTRAL: The sentence does not provide clear evidence of a specific monetary policy stance, so the class is neutral."
1,"Consumer prices had edged up in recent months,"," raising concerns about inflation
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the mention of 'consumer prices' and'recent months' may suggest an increment in the monetary policy, leading to a tightening stance."
2,"Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","
DOVISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy and climate change, indicating that the Federal Reserve needs to consider the effects of changing environmental conditions when setting rates to achieve maximum employment and price stability."
2,It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.,"
HAWKISH - The stance was characterized by the Fed aggressively raising interest rates to control rampant inflation and prevent an overheated economy. The excessive monetary policy aimed to decrease credit availability and reduce overshooting in capital spending and equity prices, hence the emphasis on 'undue optimism'."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","
DOVISH Explanation: The sentence discusses the election-related uncertainties in the US economy. Although the current stance is not tightening, there are still ongoing uncertainties, specifically pertaining to the election, which may have implications for the economy in the future."
2,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates that FOMC members viewed current inflation expectations as consistent with their long-term trend. This is a tightening of the monetary policy.
DOVISH: The sentence indicates that FOMC members viewed current inflation expectations as easing, which is a dovish stance.
NEUTRAL: The sentence suggests a neutral stance on inflation expectations, as there is no clear indication of either tightening or easing."
0,"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation.","
HAWKISH. The sentence refers to the recent reduction in the federal funds rate, which usually indicates a loosening of monetary policy to stimulate the economy."
2,"Monetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy.","
DOVISH: In this context, monetary policy refers to the Federal Reserve's actions to increase interest rates and reduce money supply to combat inflation and stimulate economic growth."
0,"So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect effects.","
HAWKISH. The sentence discusses the indirect effects of monetary policy changes on the economy, suggesting a hawkish stance as the Federal Reserve has lowered rates to stimulate growth."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a situation where the FOMC's monetary policy stance has been more restrictive, leading to a decrease in the availability of part-time employment and involuntary short-term labor force participation."
1,"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.","
'HAWKish' - As this sentence indicates the FOMC's commitment to tighten monetary policy in the near future, the label would be 'HAWKish'. This classifies the sentence as tightening the monetary policy stance. The reason behind this label is to maintain consistency with the classification of similar statements."
0,"Additionally, by depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in figure 4.","
HAWKISH. This is because the FOMC's actions to tighten monetary policy, including raising interest rates to discourage borrowing and reduce inflation, have a pronounced effect on external demand. As a result, the strength of the US dollar reflects a combination of domestic and foreign factors, with the former being the primary contributor. The label 'DOVISH' follows similar reasoning, as easing monetary policy leads to weaker perceived rates of return globally and, subsequently, a stronger US dollar. 'NEUTRAL' is used when the stance is not clearly tightening or easing, as it reflects a balanced effect of domestic and foreign factors on the currency."
2,"Because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate","
'DOVISH'
Explanation: This is because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a macroeconomic environment that is characterized by stable inflation and economic growth. Therefore, this environment is often referred to as 'dovish.'"
1,"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff.","
HAWKISH The FOMC members expressed a more optimistic view on future economic output than the staffers. The term 'HAWKISH' refers to a tightening of monetary policy, which usually leads to a slowdown in economic activity."
2,But it’s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.,"
HAWKISH. This is because fluctuations in asset prices can indicate changes in underlying macroeconomic variables and may give insights into monetary policy actions."
2,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,"
FOMC > DOVISH: In this sentence, the Federal Reserve is implementing a dovish (cautious) monetary policy, as the author mentions the pressure on limited supply resources and the persistent long-run inflation expectations."
2,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.,"
HAWKISH. Longer-term inflation expectations remained elevated due to the FOMC's hawkish monetary policy, which was characterized by rate hikes to combat high inflation."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy, specifically the concern regarding forecasts of money growth. The term 'hawkish' here refers to the members being cautious about the possibility of excessive money growth, which often results in tighter policies."
0,"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes an increase in the unemployment rate in recent downturns, caused by people remaining in the labor force despite the introduction of emergency unemployment benefits. This could be seen as the economy approaching full employment, and is therefore labeled 'HAWKISH'."
2,"This conclusion is buttressed by recent sizable increases estimated for labor productivity for the manufacturing sector, derived from a data system that, for the most part, is independent of the national accounts.","
FOMC - HAWKISH
The sentence describes an increase in labor productivity in the manufacturing sector, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy."
2,"Survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable,","
DOVISH Expected future inflation remained stable.
In the sentence, survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable, indicating a dovish monetary policy stance by the Federal Open Market Committee."
2,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","
DOVISH. The sentence projects a declining unemployment rate in the future, indicating a tight monetary policy stance."
2,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.","
FOMC - HAWKISH
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decreased the federal funds rate in 2017, indicating a hawkish monetary stance. As unemployment decreased and inflation remained low, this decision reflects a tightening monetary policy."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC is likely to tighten monetary policy, as they perceive risks to economic growth and inflation to be tilted towards the downside. (Explanation: In financial markets, hawkish monetary policy is typically associated with a more aggressive stance, while dovish policy is often seen as more accommodating and easing.)"
1,Several participants reported that business contacts had expressed growing concerns about the increase in their input costs and that there were signs that an increasing number of firms were seeking to pass on these higher costs to their customers in the form of higher prices.,"
'DOVISH' - The sentence discusses increasing input costs and firms seeking to pass them on to customers; this aligns with the description of an increasing dovish stance by the FOMC."
2,"There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.","
HAWKISH, short term market volatility and expectations of future inflation due to the monetary policy stance focused on growth."
2,"Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a drop in housing activity that occurred towards the end of the peak summer months. However, there has been a recent increase in demand for single-family housing due to lower mortgage rates, causing a rebound in an index of homebuying conditions."
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","
HAWKISH, i.e., 'a monetary policy stance that is more accommodative than neutral, typically accompanied by easing measures to stimulate economic growth.' Low unemployment and the absence of inflation warrant a HAWKISH stance. The reason is that the Federal Reserve usually associates a decrease in unemployment with an increasing demand for loanable funds, which would lead to an increase in the money supply and hence inflationary pressures. As a result, monetary policy measures aimed at stimulating economic growth might be necessary."
0,"Indeed, some expressed the concern that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might run below mandate-consistent levels for some time.","
DOVISH: This sentence discusses monetary policy decisions, specifically whether the current policy stance is tight or loose. The explanation is that with resource slack and low inflation concerns, the Fed may need to adjust its current monetary policy to remain consistent with its long-term goals."
2,"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.","
HAWKISH: This lack of congressional momentum is characterized by a neutral absence of strong opinions, potentially indicating Congress's stance on a relatively stable inflation rate, or a preference to not interfere with the current monetary policy."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","
Neutr"

HAWKISH. The term 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance characterized by tight measures to control inflation and/or maintain a high level of real economic activity. The FOMC's September 2017 announcement, unveiling a new monetary policy framework (which included raising the Fed funds rate by 0.25 percentage points), can be considered hawkish since it indicates an intention to combat inflationary pressures."
2,"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","
HAWKISH - Members agreed that, in light of softer-than-expected labor market data and uncertainty about inflation, it is advisable to delay implementing further monetary policy tightening. The explanation: The term 'hawkish' denotes a monetary policy stance that is more restrictive than neutral. In this case, the FOMC's decision to maintain a cautious approach to policy normalization, considering the mixed signals on labor market conditions and inflation outlook, aligns with the word's definition."
2,"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Ellen Zentner, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","
NEUTRAL - In this sentence, I look forward to my conversation with Ellen Zentner, and I first provide a remark on the economic outlook and new monetary policy framework before discussing Federal Reserve monetary policy."
2,"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).","
HAWKISH: In this case, the FOMC's discussion of providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy may be viewed as a tightening of the monetary policy stance, hence classifying it as HAWKISH. The SEP has been enhanced with options for providing additional information on the economic projections, indicating a corresponding tightening of the monetary policy stance."
2,"Members also agreed that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","
DOVISH: Members discussed the wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation measures, and international developments. In this case, the sentence is classified as DOVISH because it indicates a tightening of the monetary policy stance."
0,"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action.","
HAWKISH - Members calling for tight monetary policy in the current meeting. The explanation: The sentence discusses the members who advocate for easing; their view is based on the current situation where inflation and wage pressures are already evident."
2,"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","
DOVISH - The sentence discusses the FOMC's decisions regarding the pace of asset purchases, which are based on their expectations for labor market and inflation. These decisions will be influenced by the Committee's analysis of the efficacy and costs of such purchases; thus, the label is 'DOVISH'."
2,"In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the FOMC members discuss a strengthening global economy and the impact on exports, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
2,"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005",")
NEUTRAL. Short-term changes in U.S. short-term interest rates have considerable impact on euro area bond yields. The rationale behind this classification is that the sentence discusses the relationship between U.S. interest rates and euro area bond yields, implying a global scope, which would categorize the sentence as 'DOVISH.'"
2,"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes a slowdown in economic growth that resulted in excess inventory accumulation, particularly in industries closely tied to the motor vehicle sector. This can indicate a more cautious monetary policy stance."
2,"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?","
HAWKISH. This label means that the central bank is tightening the monetary policy, hence leading to a decrease in investment spending due to higher interest rates."
2,Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.,"
DOVISH. The sentence describes a monetary policy stance wherein the FOMC members emphasized the substantial role of business spending in influencing economic growth. This classification is based on the fact that the monetary policy easing is aimed at boosting economic activity, particularly through business investments."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","HAWKISH""
FOMC - ""HAWKISH"": The sentence describes a balanced approach to monetary policy, indicating that the Committee will begin to remove accommodation. The term 'hawkish' denotes a tightening of policies, in this case, a higher likelihood of higher interest rates."
0,"So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year.","
HAWKISH - This is a reference to an increase in short-term interest rates to combat inflation. (Inflation is an economic variable that measures the overall rise in prices over time. By tightening monetary policy, the FOMC aims to combat excessive price increases, which can lead to economic instability and long-term growth issues.)"
2,"Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) actions related to monetary policy, specifically, their decision-making style (tightening vs. easing). Thus, it is classified as HAWKISH."
0,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.","
HAWKISH
The sentence describes the FOMC's current monetary policy stance that is characterized by a gradual increase in interest rates to counter inflationary pressures. This policy typically results in a more restrictive monetary environment, causing economic growth to potentially slow down."
0,"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.","
HAWKISH - A tightening of the monetary policy is indicated when the FOMC lowers interest rates to decrease money supply and potentially increase inflation. This is because a higher money growth rate often results from a more accommodative monetary policy stance, causing price inflation and economic instability."
2,"But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.","
DOVISH: In this example, 'low unemployment rates and tight labor markets' are associated with monetary policy that is 'tightening,' resulting in companies absorbing wage increases rather than raising prices."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","
HAWKISH - A HAWKISH classification for a sentence indicating a significant tightening of the monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve is likely to reduce the money supply to combat inflation."
0,"In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.","
HAWKISH: In response to deteriorating economic conditions and a decrease in inflationary pressures, central banks lowered interest rates and eased monetary policy to stimulate growth. (Reasoning: The sentence describes a monetary policy move to counter a slowdown and declining inflation, which typically would be associated with a more dovish stance.)"
1,"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC statement indicates a recent rise in oil prices, which could lead to a change in monetary policy to counteract inflation."

2,Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.,"
HAWKISH - Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support. The term 'HAWKISH' refers to a policy stance that is more aggressive, often involving higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy, to combat inflation and promote economic growth."
1,"However, participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated, with the 12-month change in the PCE price index reaching 3.","
DOVISH: The sentence refers to the FOMC's recent announcement of an increase in interest rates, likely indicating a tightening of the monetary policy. A 3-month change in the PCE price index reflects a notable rise in inflation, thus aligning with this dovish stance."
2,"1 The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.","
FOMC (HAWKISH) | The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under a more stringent monetary policy. | Monetary policy tightening.  
FOMC (DOVISH) | The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under a less stringent monetary policy. | Monetary policy easing. | The sentence is about participants' opinions on the rate convergence dynamics."
2,"Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses Federal Reserve's open market operations since September to implement monetary policy, focusing on current and forthcoming measures."
2,"Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me.","
NEUTRAL. This sentence is an example of monetary policy being 'on hold,' as it discusses a neutral stance on employment, prices, and the monetary policy itself, rather than presenting any specific measures."
2,the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.,"
HAWKISH: The effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices has seemingly been limited. (Explanation: The term 'HAWKISH' refers to a monetary policy stance that involves gradual increases in interest rates to control inflation.)"
2,"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.","
Neutral. Explanation: The sentence discusses the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, which requires mortgage lenders to report data on loan applications. The concern mentioned can be seen as an issue with access to credit, which would fall under the 'DOVISH' category."
2,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the implementation of monetary policy during the current period. It is labeled as 'HAWKISH' because it indicates a tightening of the policy. 

DOVISH: The sentence talks about the current economic and financial outlook, which is not directly related to the implementation of monetary policy. It is labeled as 'DOVISH' because it indicates an easing of the policy. 

NEUTRAL: The sentence describes the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period. It is neutral, as it does not provide any specific information regarding tightening or easing."
2,"It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the FOMC's monetary policy stance that is focused on keeping unemployment rates low. The word 'hawkish' here refers to the tightening of monetary policy.
DOVISH: The word 'dovish' is not applicable as the sentence does not relate to a specific monetary policy stance.
NEUTRAL: As the sentence does not indicate a preference for tightening or easing the monetary policy, the word 'neutral' is most suitable to classify this sentence."
2,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","
HAWKISH; The recent lack of data makes it difficult to determine whether the trend has continued since 1992, as it is likely that the strong economic performance and ample credit availability have contributed to the growth of innovative businesses."
2,"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Fed's monetary policy has been relatively Hawkish. The explanation: The Fed has kept the monetary policy largely unchanged, which is a hawkish stance given the Taylor Rule's recommendation for gradual adjustments. The Rule suggests that the Fed should keep the interest rate at a level slightly above the current nominal GDP growth rate, thus monetary policy has been more hawkish than dovish recently."
2,"In addition, some of the correlation may reflect the effect of the response of monetary policy to exchange rate developments.","
HAWKISH: This refers to the FOMC's tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. The explanation: The sentence suggests that a portion of the correlation between the FOMC's monetary policy and exchange rate developments might be due to the FOMC's hawkish stance on rates."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","
DOVISH - Due to the June employment report and Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony, investors revised down their expected policy path. A tightening bias is implied due to the decrease in expected monetary policy."
2,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,"
HAWKISH: Due to the reduction in monetary and fiscal policy stimulus, which is typically associated with a tightening of the stance, the effects on the economy might become more hawkish. In this case, the long-term interest rates and energy-related headwinds might be expected to diminish as well."
2,"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.","
HAWKISH. This sentence discusses the stance of inflation expectations in the monetary policy. The label is based on the discussion of businesses being the price setters, which is consistent with monetary tightening."
2,"Financial markets seem to think the sameâ€”5-year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent, and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures are around 2 percent, when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index) and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates.6 Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long.","
HAWKISH - Markets believe current inflationary pressures due to factors like 5-year breakeven expectations are short-lived, hence monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative."
2,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","
HAWKISH. Monetary policy tightening: The Fed is less likely to provide money to small businesses and workers, and more likely to focus on controlling inflation."
2,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.","
DOVISH. The Fed's monetary policy tool affecting interest rates and asset prices for households, businesses, and the overall economy (short-term rate)."
0,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.","
HAWKISH: The sentence talks about monetary policy, specifically about expectations that energy prices will level out and suggests that rents might decrease in the future. This classifies the sentence as HAWKISH."
2,The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.,"
HAWKISH - This label indicates a tightening of the monetary policy, as the Committee is paying close attention to inflation and inflation expectations. The short explanation is: 'Inflation hawk' refers to a monetary policy stance that is focused on controlling inflation and promoting stable prices."
0,"In the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation.","
HAWKISH: The Fed raising rates to combat inflation. DOVISH: The Fed implementing dovish monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. NEUTRAL: The Fed maintaining an unchanged monetary policy to stabilize the economy."
2,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.","
DOVISH: This is an explanation of the monetary policy stance. In 1997, the FOMC decided to keep the monetary aggregates and debt in check, much like in 1996, by setting the ranges for them accordingly."
1,"In these circumstances, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.","
HAWKISH: This sentence discusses monetary policy and indicates a hawkish (tightening) stance, as the Federal Reserve is mentioned and 'emergency powers' were referenced ('temporary easing of monetary policy'). DOVISH: This sentence discusses easing of monetary policy and is categorized as dovish (easing) due to the reference to the'relatively limited policy adjustment.' NEUTRAL: The sentence is neutral, so the classification as NEUTRAL is appropriate."
1,Participants' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period.,"
'HAWKISH' -> The FOMC members discussed increasing their interest rates to combat inflation. 
'DOVISH' -> The FOMC members discussed implementing more accommodative monetary policies to stimulate the economy. 
'NEUTRAL' -> The FOMC members maintained their relatively neutral stance on monetary policy."
0,"A few members observed that, in their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions--including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee's objective--could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a potential change in monetary policy, as it could lead to an increase in the money supply and might result in higher interest rates. In line with this explanation, I classify the sentence as HAWKISH."
2,This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.,"
HAWKISH; The Federal Open Market Committee increased the fed funds rate by a quarter percentage point at their June 30th meeting, which was viewed as a hawkish move to combat inflation."
0,"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy tightening, as it suggests that accepting slightly higher inflation can lead to long-term lower unemployment rates. A tightening monetary policy often involves raising interest rates to combat inflation."
2,"If this high-pressure management inadvertently carried the economy beyond its productive potential, some cost in terms of inflation could be expected,","
DOVISH - It is corresponding to easing of the monetary policy, as it implies an economy being over-tightened and the potential for inflation."
2,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.,"
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Federal Reserve is discussing their projections for a moderate, long-term increase in interest rates to combat inflation. Thus, it can be classified as HAWKISH."
2,"First, with more complete information available, markets will price financial assets more efficiently.","
HAWKISH - Markets are expected to price financial assets more efficiently due to the increased clarity on central bank policies, which may lead to tighter monetary conditions and a higher likelihood of interest rate hikes."
0,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.","
HAWKISH
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a shift in their monetary policy by raising interest rates in December 2018. This reflects a somewhat slower projected global growth and tightening in credit conditions."
0,"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an economic situation where there was a decline in stock prices, which is typically associated with a monetary policy tightening to combat inflation. The explanation provided is to differentiate from DOVISH stance, where the central bank would not actively decrease interest rates to stimulate the economy, and instead focuses on maintaining the stability of the financial system."
2,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","
FOMC: HAWKISH. The current monetary policy is neutral, maintaining a low neutral rate, Phillips curve, and underlying inflation. Financial imbalances may become more tightly linked to the business cycle. Monetary policy tools such as rate adjustments can help temper the financial cycle."
2,"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.","
HAWKISH - Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, which indicates a slightly more accommodative monetary policy stance than usual. The explanation: Monetary policy is becoming more expansionary, as indicated by the Committee monitoring inflation closely, suggesting a possible slight dovish tilt."
1,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.","
FOMC - NEUTRAL Explanation: If the sentence refers to a situation where the economy is overheating, threatening to cause high inflation, it would be classified as NEUTRAL. The reason is that the reference to an undesirably high level of inflation indicates a tighter monetary policy stance, which falls under the category of NEUTRAL."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","
'DOVISH' - The sentence talks about various factors affecting the economy, implying that the Fed is likely to tighten monetary policy, leading to higher interest rates and possible decrease in economic growth."
2,"Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180, 000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year.","
HAWKISH. This sentence describes a relatively rapid increase in nonfarm payroll employment, which, if maintained, would indicate a tight monetary policy. However, the FOMC's recent decision to keep monetary policy accommodative suggests a dovish stance in the short term."
0,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.","
Inflation pressures remain muted (HAWKISH), as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has maintained a fairly stable monetary policy to keep inflation in check. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges (DOVISH), suggesting a relatively stable economic environment with subdued inflationary pressures. (NEUTRAL)"
1,Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.,"
DOVISH. This sentence indicates that businesses are raising prices in response to increased input costs, which typically signals a tightening of the monetary policy."
0,"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened, which usually leads to a decrease in spending and an increase in prices. This can cause economic instability and may lead to a decrease in employment. In the given sentence, recent research emphasizes the disadvantages of maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate. A tightening of the monetary policy, as mentioned, often results in these issues."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","
HAWKISH - In this sentence, the FOMC is tightening the monetary policy, as there are reports of difficulty in finding qualified workers and limited ability to expand business due to labor shortages."
1,"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.","
HAWKISH. Good economic growth since the last meeting suggests that the current monetary policy is tightening, and capacity expansion does not appear to have accelerated, thus contributing to a neutral stance."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"
HAWKISH: Members agreed to continue monitoring inflation developments closely, indicating a tightening of the monetary policy stance. DOVISH: Members agreed to continue observing inflation developments, signaling an easing of the monetary policy stance. NEUTRAL: The sentence presented a neutral stance on inflation developments, not indicating a tightening or easing of the monetary policy."
2,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.","
DOVISH: The FOMC's recent monetary policy decisions have been characterized by the gradual withdrawal of stimulus, which is gradually normalizing interest rates and money supply. In this context, 'DOVISH' would be a fit label for FOMC actions related to this shift.

(1) The text discusses recent changes in the nature of money, as well as the impact on monetary policy."
2,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","
FOMC: NEUTRAL
Explanation: The Chairman's frequent appearances before Congress, including those focused on the subject of monetary policy, do not indicate a clear stance, making this sentence neutral."
0,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","
HAWKISH - An expected tightening of monetary policy abroad would lead to increased economic activity domestically, and thus, imports might rise, causing a decline in the trade balance. The rise in the US dollar's appreciation would also contribute to a decline in real GDP."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","
DOVISH. Here, the policy directive focuses on'monetary and financial conditions' and 'fostering price stability', which are characteristic of a dovish stance. Consequently, the sentence is labeled 'DOVISH'."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","
NEUTRAL. This sentence describes a general understanding of the equilibrium real rate, which aids in analyzing supply and demand movements over a longer period."
1,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.,"
DOVISH - Broad-based inflation, where prices in the economy are increasing due to increased money supply or higher production costs, resulting in reduced purchasing power."
2,"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent.","

2,"The European Central Bank (ECB) began operating on June 1, 1998, and assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area on January 1, 1999.","
HAWKISH, explanation: The ECB was established to ensure price stability in the Euro zone. Since it began operating on June 1, 1998, and took over monetary policy in the euro area from January 1, 1999, the institution has been seen as hawkish.
DOVISH, explanation: The ECB's monetary policy has been characterized as dovishly accommodative since its inception in 1998, as it continuously implements expansionary monetary measures to bolster the euro area economy. This description fits the current context where the ECB is in a dovish stance.
NEUTRAL, explanation: The ECB's policies have been relatively neutral since its inception in 1998, as it implements an accommodative monetary policy to stabilize the euro area economy. Consequently, the current description fits the current neutral stance of the central bank."
2,"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?","
HAWKISH: This classification applies when the FOMC's policy stance is characterized by an increase in the short-term interest rates to combat high inflation. The explanation is that tightening the money supply usually results in higher interest rates to discourage consumer spending and decrease production, thus decreasing inflation. The sentence 'Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?' is labeled HAWKISH because it refers to a monetary policy stance which is tight, i.e., the money supply is increased to combat inflation as a result of globalization."
2,"These indicators suggested that the financial system was fairly resilient, as did the absence of a significant increase in funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when prices of risky assets fell and volatility rose sharply.","
DOVISH - Declining overall financial conditions indicate an easing of monetary policy, and the absence of significant funding stresses or margin calls in an adverse financial situation."
1,"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.","
HAWKISH The sentence discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to raise interest rates to combat inflation, which can be seen as a tightening of monetary policy."
1,"And I really don’t have much for you other than to say that they will be data dependent—that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a track where we see continuing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC statement indicates that the Fed will carefully consider changes in the current monetary policy to keep the economy on a steady path toward maximum employment and price stability. The term 'data dependency' suggests that the Fed will adjust its policy stance based on the incoming data, which may lead to either tighter or more easing measures, depending on the data's characteristics."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","
HAWKISH: This is because the FOMC is expected to increase short-term interest rates in the near term to combat rising inflation, leading to tighter financial conditions, and thus, higher interest rates on inflation-indexed Treasury securities. 

DOVISH: This is because the FOMC is expected to maintain the current monetary policy, which has been characterized by low interest rates, in order to stimulate economic growth, and thus lower the inflation rate. 

NEUTRAL: This is because the FOMC has been implementing a 'data-dependent' policy, adjusting the monetary policy based on various economic indicators, including inflation, and thus, the stance is neutral at this time."
2,"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","
FOMC | HAWKISH
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is an influential entity in the US economy. They are responsible for monetary policy and have the ability to influence economic growth. In this sentence, 'forecasters' refers to economists and analysts who study economic data, and'modest, but stable' growth' is an example of a HAWKISH stance, as it implies a controlled and predictable rise in economic activity."

DOVISH: The sentence describes the current monetary policy stance, which is characterized by monetary easing to boost economic growth and maintain price stability."
1,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","

0,Higher and more stable growth combined with better ability to undertake long-term plans can help to improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence talks about a country's improving fiscal outlook which could lead to tighter monetary policy in the long run, hence the label. (The reason behind this categorization is that monetary policy decisions aim to influence growth and long-term plans directly by targeting inflation; thus, tightening policies are generally considered as hawkish.)"
2,such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.,"
HAWKISH - Exerting monetary policy to tighten conditions, which could result in higher interest rates, reduced money supply, and fewer loanable funds."
0,"also, continued solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the growth of U. S. exports for some period ahead.","
HAWKISH The FOMC statement implies a firming of monetary policy, likely to result in short-term higher interest rates to combat inflation. This would lead to higher U.S. exports, thus boosting economic growth."
0,"The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.","
HAWKISH: The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely, as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn. The explanation: 'HAWKISH' is used for tightening of the monetary policy, where a decrease in the money supply is aimed to combat high spending and stimulate a slowdown in economic growth."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"
HAWKISH. This is because the FOMC decision to raise interest rates in October indicates a tighter monetary policy, which typically leads to a stronger USD and higher nonfarm payroll employment."
0,"Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has recently decided to tighten monetary policy, thus indicating an expected decrease in economic activity and possible job loss."
0,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","
HAWKISH: The sentence is referring to the increase in short-term interest rates to combat inflation. It is labeled as HAWKISH because this is an example of a hawk-like monetary policy move. DOVISH: This is because lowering interest rates can lead to an increase in the money supply, thus increasing inflation. It is labeled as DOVISH due to the easing of monetary policy. NEUTRAL: Although the sentence talks about breakevens, it doesn't specifically mention monetary policy. As a result, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"Consumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in October.","
HAWKISH. This sentence discusses inflation and monetary policy. Consumer price inflation stayed moderate in November, with both the overall inflation rate and the excluding food and energy items inflation rate remaining low. As a result, the monetary policy stance remained relatively hawkish."
2,"Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) present evidence of a strong correlation between fiscal deficits and money creation in high-inflation economies.","
Label: HAWKISH. Explanation: In high-inflation economies, the central bank frequently resorts to money creation to stimulate aggregate demand, and the fiscal deficit is often considered an indicator of inflationary pressures. Thus, a high correlation between fiscal deficits and money creation, as shown by Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002), would reflect an HAWKISH monetary policy."
1,"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial instability, or both.","
FOMC 'Neutral' - It refers to an ambiguous or unclear situation, where there is little guidance on the future monetary policy stance."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","
HAWKISH. This label is assigned as it indicates a tightening of the monetary policy stance, as the sentence describes a relatively robust spending performance during a cyclical downturn, implying a more restrictive approach in the near future."
2,Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.,"
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened, so the current sentence corresponds to it, i.e.,'some participants noted that...' DOVISH: The monetary policy stance is being eased, so the current sentence corresponds to it, i.e.,'some participants noted...' NEUTRAL: The sentence provides no clear information about the stance, so we cannot label it confidently. However, it may be considered in the category of 'NEUTRAL' due to its lack of directional guidance."
2,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.","
DOVISH. The FOMC's decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level and their statement keeping the ""extended period"" language in the statement, both indicate a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","
DOVISH: The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC)'s recent statement suggests they'll keep their current accommodative monetary policy, implying a low chance of immediate rate hikes. The rationale behind this is likely based on the expectation of weaker economic conditions, which would lead to lower inflation and labor market improvements. This is consistent with the neutral stance on the labor market, as improvements in this area could offset any potential inflationary pressures."
2,"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.","
DOVISH: In this context, the sentence describes a tightening of a fixed exchange rate regime. The monetary policy stance is being tightened, as it becomes more expensive to exit the regime. The label 'DOVISH' is used because this tightening can lead to a depreciating currency, which is typically seen as a bearish economic outcome."
0,"Rather, it is that the underlying sources of productivity growth are very complex.","
HAWKISH - The sentence discusses monetary policy, specifically, the Fed's decisions regarding the money supply. It suggests that the current policy is tightening, as opposed to the neutral or dovish label. The word 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy that aims for higher interest rates and decreases money supply."
0,"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection.","
DOVISH. This is because, although headline inflation remains low, core inflation decelerated in the last projection, thus pointing to a less aggressive monetary policy stance."
1,wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.,"
HAWKISH. The increase in wholesale prices suggests a tighter monetary policy. This is because the Fed has been using monetary tightening to combat inflation. A tightening monetary policy often leads to higher interest rates and reduced borrowing, which in turn can contribute to a stronger US dollar and, subsequently, rising prices."
2,"And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy.","
DOVISH. Explanation: The sentence discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's decision regarding interest rates, which is a monetary policy tool. It conveys that the committee's actions don't have a significant impact on inflation and the wider economy in the long run."
0,"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC's actions aimed at reducing the amount of money supply and raising interest rates to combat inflation and promote price stability. The sentence describes an accommodative monetary policy, which generally results in a decrease in the money supply and higher interest rates to combat inflation.
DOVISH - The FOMC's actions that lead to an increase in the amount of money supply, lower interest rates, and possibly looser credit conditions can be classified as dovish. This is because a decrease in the money supply and lower interest rates can lead to higher inflation, which is generally a disinflationary monetary policy.
NEUTRAL - The sentence describes a neutral monetary policy stance, which aims to keep the monetary policy in a stable, neutral position that doesn't favor either inflation or deflation. As a result, the money supply remains relatively stable, and the credit conditions are neither tightened nor loosed."
2,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent,","
In this sentence, 'HAWKISH' would be the label, as it refers to the current monetary policy stance, which is tightening. In simple terms, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been increasing interest rates to combat high inflation. Rising interest rates are typically associated with 'HAWKISH' policies, which means the FOMC is actively fighting inflation."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"
HAWKISH. This is because the Federal Reserve is increasing interest rates to combat inflationary pressures caused by over-expanded aggregate supply in the economy."
2,"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.","
HAWKISH; The sentence discusses monetary policy and how a rise in excess reserves or the monetary base may not effectively stimulate the economy or increase prices due to the impaired bank intermediation mechanism."
0,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.","
FOMC, HAWKISH, DOVISH
FOMC stands for Federal Open Market Committee, HAWKISH is a term we use for monetary policy that is highly accommodating and could lead to inflation concerns. DOVISH refers to a monetary policy stance that results in more easing. In the sentence, the speaker expresses concern about potential tightening in labor markets if the economy performs well as expected."
1,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","
DOVISH. This is because the FOMC participant is expressing doubt regarding the current monetary policy's effectiveness in easing inflation."
0,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","
HAWKISH; The low funds rate, currently near zero, has been a key instrument in the Fed's toolbox to promote growth and reduce slack in resource utilization, providing accommodative monetary policy in the near term."
2,One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,"
FOMC sentence classification: (1) Neutral. The sentence is about the labor market, which is classified as 'DOVISH' in this case. (2) One involves the zero bound on nominal interest rates, which is classified as 'HAWKISH'."
0,"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the rise in foreign exchange value of the dollar and the anticipated consequences on US exports and substitution of imports. The monetary policy is tightened, hence the HAWKISH label."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","
HAWKISH, 0.4% decrease in core CPI in April, indicating an increase in prices."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"
FOMC sentence classification: NEUTRAL. The sentence discusses the Fed's role in setting monetary policy and its impact on the market. The explanation is that the stance is not hawkish or dovish, but an attempt to provide guidance on market expectations for future Fed actions."
1,They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,"
HAWKISH. This is a monetary policy tightening, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is increasing the interest rates to combat inflation caused by higher energy prices."
0,"moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks.","
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates a monetary policy stance that is somewhat tight or hawkish, as slow economic growth makes the recovery more fragile and susceptible to negative events."
1,The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.,"5%
HAWKISH; This is because the FOMC statement indicates an increment in interest rates, which typically results in a tighter monetary policy, thus lowering the unemployment rate."
0,Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year,".
DOVISH: The sentence describes a scenario where firms are implementing significant cost-cutting measures, likely to result in productivity growth. This can be considered a 'hawkish' monetary policy as it implies a tightening stance."
1,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","
DOVISH (The stance is dovish because the FOMC is not increasing interest rates to counter inflation, which would traditionally result in firms raising their prices.)"
2,"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.","
HAWKISH. In this sentence, 'HAWKISH' refers to a tightening of the monetary policy which can lead to higher prices. This would typically be a short-term approach to combat inflation. The rationale behind it is that higher prices might reduce aggregate demand, thus eventually lead to price stability."
2,"If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the FOMC's stance on monetary policy in a somewhat ambiguous manner. The central question is whether a specific range for inflation is targeted, and if so, whether it is neutral or tightening. The sentence implies the possibility of both scenarios, which makes it DOVISH."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","
HAWKISH. This label indicates that the text describes a tightening of the monetary policy, likely to combat inflation and decrease the funds rate to control market expectations for high future earnings growth. The sentence discusses an easing of the funds rate to combat inflationary pressures and the lack of damping effect on investor beliefs regarding the potential profitability of emerging technologies."
2,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence mentions inflation and the current monetary policy, which are both related to economic conditions. It can be classified as HAWKISH."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"
HAWKISH - The monetary policy easing is aimed at increasing economic growth and employment, which are typically associated with an easing of supply constraints, and can lead to inflation in the long term. The label 'DOVISH' should be used when the expectation is for a decrease in supply constraints, resulting in a slowdown in economic activity and employment, rather than an increase. This could be accompanied by a decrease in inflation. Lastly, 'NEUTRAL' should be used when the monetary policy stance is neutral or uncertain, with a lack of significant changes expected in economic variables."
2,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.,"
HAWKISH. Inventory investment is expected to decrease and thus contribute to a moderation in economic activity, which might lead to tighter monetary policy."
0,"In agriculture, depressed levels of crop prices and weak global demand continued to weaken farm income.","
DOVISH. This label is given because the sentence describes a decrease in the value of agricultural products, which typically results from easing monetary policy."
1,What policy options exist to deal with the U.S. current account deficit?,"
NEUTRAL. The sentence discusses the U.S. current account deficit and the policy options to deal with it. The term 'NEUTRAL' indicates a neutral or balanced approach and does not provide specific information on tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.","
DOVISH Explanation: The Fed is decreasing the money supply to combat inflation and stimulate economic growth in the long-run."
1,Core measures of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly so over the last few months.,"
HAWKISH: The FOMC has been gradually raising rates to combat inflation that has been picking up in recent periods. Core price inflation has been increasing, and the central bank believes tighter monetary policy is necessary to keep inflation in check."
0,Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.,"
HAWKISH: This classification is given as the current monetary policy is characterized by a tight money supply to combat inflation and support economic growth."
2,"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.","
DOVISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy in general, describing it as a blunt instrument unable to be targeted at specific industries or regions."
1,"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.","
HAWKISH - The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered monetary policy in 2020, causing an increase in the GDP growth rate and a decline in the unemployment rate; thus, the sentence can be classified as HAWKISH."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is tight, which may lead to a decrease in aggregate demand, lower inflation, and a stronger dollar. Innovation and globalization may increase the economy's growth potential, but they can also create job losses and trade imbalances. DOVISH: The monetary policy is loose, which may lead to an increase in aggregate demand and higher inflation expectations. Rationalize inflationary concerns as economic growth is expected to outpace inflation. NEUTRAL: The monetary policy stance is neutral, as inflation expectations remain stable, and there are no major economic shocks."
2,"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened due to the rise in commodity prices. (Explanation: HAWKISH is an acronym for 'heightened monetary policy, anticipatory fiscal stance, and large-scale asset purchases' which means a significant expansion of money supply and/or fiscal measures to combat inflation.)"
1,"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","
DOVISH. The explanation: This is because the Fed's recent decision to maintain the accommodative monetary policy stance, focusing on stimulating economic growth, is consistent with the recent trends in CRE market conditions and loan growth."
1,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.","
NEUTRAL: At these low rates, the central bank is currently in a neutral stance, not favoring tightening or easing, and thus may not be well-positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks."
0,"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience."," The correlation between monetary policy and macroecomomic outcomes has been studied and documented in the post-Bretton Woods eraâ€¢. In the aftermath of the GPC and the GFC, a large number of studies were conducted that focused on the macroecomomic implications of the correlation between central bank monetary policy and economic outcomes. In my remarks today, I want to focus on the following question: Is global monetary policy coordination important? The answer is unequivocal: Yes, it is. The reason is the same reason that is used by many central banks to justify their actionsâ€¢.

0,"I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from—mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing—has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, and people are having a hard time there.","
HAWKISH
FOMC member Janet Yellen mentioned 'certain parts of South Carolina' that had 'developed pretty strongly', which implies a tightening of the monetary policy. The economy in these areas is likely to become more restrictive."
2,"As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth.","
NEUTRAL This sentence describes a policymaker's perspective on the current economic conditions, indicating that a combination of monetary policy and fiscal policy contributed to noninflationary growth, thereby classifying it as 'DOVISH'."
1,"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.","
HAWKISH. This sentence discusses Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policies regarding quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is an extension of monetary policy that aims to increase the money supply, leading to increased economic growth, and the sentence suggests a tightening of policy, which would be classified as HAWKISH."
1,"In addition, though the unemployment rate has fallen since the middle of 2003, the participation rate currently remains near the low point reached in the first half of 2004.","
FOMC: Neutral - As the sentence does not provide information about the current monetary policy stance."
1,The unemployment rate fell to 5.,"1%
HAWKISH. The unemployment rate fell due to the Federal Reserve's decision to raise interest rates, indicating a more aggressive stance on monetary policy."
2,"Over time, spot prices are inexorably drawn back to the long-term equilibrium price, as the balance between underlying supply and demand is restored.","
'HAWKISH' - In this sentence, the Federal Reserve is using a tightening monetary policy, as they are raising interest rates to reduce overall borrowing and spending, hence bringing the spot prices back to their long-term equilibrium level. This is expected to decrease inflationary pressures and potentially lead to economic growth."
0,"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports.","
HAWKISH: The statement describes a monetary policy stance that is characterized by a sudden decrease in the money supply, which aims to combat inflation by reducing economic growth. The reason behind such a policy is the fear of inflation that might emerge due to the easy money situation."
0,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","
'HAWKISH' Label: The sentence indicates the Committee's intention to tighten monetary policy in the near term. This would result in higher interest rates, likely causing inflation. The short explanation: The FOMC is concerned about inflation running below the 2% level for too long, so it plans to implement hawkish policies to address this issue."
1,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","
DOVISH - The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down due to current economic conditions that may lead to a slowdown in inflation."
2,"In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged,"," while the U.S. economy continues to expand
FOMC = 'HAWKISH'
The stance is neutral. In Japan, consumer prices remained stable, and the U.S. economy kept growing, so I labelled the sentence as 'HAWKISH'."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance that remains uncertain, and thus money growth projections are not clearly aligned with the Committee's objectives. Monetary policy remains accommodative."
0,"In the household sector, mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s, reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices.","
'HAWKISH': In accordance with the FOMC's June 2015 decision to gradually raise short-term interest rates, mortgage debt growth eased.
'DOVISH': The sentence is neutral, as it does not provide information on the stance of the monetary policy."
0,Microeconomic studies provide corroborating information to the macroeconomic evidence of a post-1995 acceleration in productivity growth.,"
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the significant increase in productivity growth after 1995, which is consistent with the idea of a post-1995 acceleration."
1,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.","
'HAWKISH': In this sentence, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a relatively hawkish stance on monetary policy, as they are still implementing tightening measures to maintain a healthy economy. This label is applicable when the stance is characterized by higher interest rates and less monetary stimulus compared to the 'DOVISH' label."
0,"I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn’t really matter whether we have one mandate or two, because we’re below our inflation target and we—unemployment is above where we’d like it to be.","
Neutral, The Federal Open Market Committee decided to maintain the current monetary policy, keeping both the mandatory long-term Treasury bond buying program and short-term interest rates at their current levels."
2,"With the Committee in the process of reviewing its monetary policy strategies and communication, and no additional accommodation being provided at this meeting, a few members indicated that they could support the Committee's decision even though they had not favored recent policy actions.","
FOMC (HAWKISH) - The monetary policy stance was tightened in this sentence, as indicated by the members who supported it even though they previously did not favor it."
0,Some survey measures of inflation expectations declined during the period.,"
HAWKISH: In the context of the sentence, the phrase'some survey measures of inflation expectations' refers to a specific topic or indicator, and the decline in its value indicates the tightening of the monetary policy. (Explanation: Survey measures of inflation expectations are typically used by central banks as an indicator of their monetary policy stance. A decrease in these survey results might signal a tightening of monetary policy by the FOMC. This classification is applicable for monetary policy-related analysis.)"
1,"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","
HAWKISH: Due to the recent increase in consumer prices, the Federal Open Market Committee raised their projection for inflation in the second half of the year. This is classified as 'HAWKISH' because it indicates a tightening of the monetary policy. The explanation: 'HAWKISH' is an acronym used by professional economists to refer to an increase in short-term interest rates to combat inflation."
2,"Moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later.","
HAWKISH (Monetary policy tightening): FOMC members see a risk of a strong increase in stock prices due to their expectation of an easing move, which could cause market disruption in the future."
0,"Partly because of high demand for Treasury securities, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral was near zero for much of the period, and failures to deliver Treasury securities reached record highs.","
HAWKISH, Explanation: In this sentence, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowered interest rates to stimulate the economy, causing high demand for Treasury securities and a resulting decrease in the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral. Subsequently, failures to deliver Treasury securities reached a record high, indicating market confidence in the U.S. government's ability to repay its debt."
0,The effects of the saving outflow may thus have been felt disproportionately on U.S. interest rates and the dollar.,"
HAWKISH - The monetary policy tightening has caused the U.S. interest rates and the dollar to be impacted more than other categories, likely inducing a hawkish stance. 

DOVISH - The easing of monetary policy is reflected in the sentence, as it indicates a dovish stance, causing a decrease in interest rates and a weaker dollar, potentially moving towards a dovish market. 

NEUTRAL - As there is no clear monetary policy stance in the sentence, it can be classified as neutral."
1,"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.","
FOMC - DOVISH: The sentence discusses the early-century projection of outsized growth in entitlement spending, which might instigate a change in current stability expectations."
0,"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is reducing the monetary policy stimulus, indicating a hawkish stance. Real GDP growth is projected to rise gradually in the upcoming years due to accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improved consumer and business sentiment."
2,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.","
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tools, specifically the short-term interest rates. Lowering short-term interest rates can lead to an increase in borrowing and spending, which could eventually result in economic growth. 

DOVISH: The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering an approach that would lead to monetary accommodation, i.e., easing. This might involve cutting interest rates or implementing other measures to increase the money supply, which could stimulate economic growth and potentially lead to inflation."
1,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the FOMC's monetary policy stance, signaling their intention to tighten in the near future. It is labeled as 'HAWKISH' because it implies a hawkish stance on inflation. DOVISH: The sentence does not indicate any change in the current monetary policy, which is considered neutral. The sentence is labeled 'DOVISH' as it does not show a specific policy change. NEUTRAL: The sentence does not provide any clear indication of a change in the current monetary policy, so it is labeled as 'NEUTRAL'."
1,"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is increasing interest rates to combat inflationary pressures.DOVISH: The FOMC is implementing monetary policy to reduce economic growth and combat inflation.NEUTRAL: No clear classification as either HAWKISH or DOVISH could be made based on this sentence. The explanation: Slack in the economy refers to spare capacity or potential output that is not being fully utilized.

HAWKISH (The monetary policy is hawkish or tightening, i.e., there is a higher chance of the central bank increasing the money supply and interest rates to combat the recession or slow down the economy)"
0,"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.","
HAWKISH - Core inflation remains stable and monetary policy is kept neutral, so there is little need for a change in policy. In the short term, rising energy prices may lead to some fluctuations in inflation, but overall, the inflation expectations are well-anchored, and thus central bankers might not need to adjust the monetary policy. 

DOVISH - Given the relatively low current inflation expectations and the stable economic growth, it is more likely that the Fed will continue its current accommodative stance, and the monetary policy will remain dovish. In the short term, there may be some fluctuations related to energy prices and other external factors, but the overall inflation outlook is expected to remain stable, so the Fed may not need to change their current policy stance.

NEUTRAL - Given the current stable inflation expectations and the slow economic growth, it is likely that the Fed will maintain a neutral monetary policy stance. The short-term fluctuations related to external factors could lead to some fluctuations in inflation, but overall, the inflation outlook is not expected to change significantly. Thus, the monetary policy will likely remain neutral."
2,"In dissenting, Mr. Meyer noted that although the money growth ranges do not play an important role in the conduct of monetary policy today, Congress has mandated that the FOMC set and report ranges for money and credit growth.","
FOMC (DOVISH): The money and credit growth reported by Mr. Meyer do not have a significant influence on the current monetary policy. (Explanation: In this case, monetary policy is defined as the use of instruments such as interest rates to manipulate the economy.

Therefore, it is crucial that policymakers take a cautious approach in the coming time to prevent overheating of the economy, so that we avoid having to reverse the current path of monetary policy.

2,"Nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends.","
HAWKISH. This is because recent inflation trends have been influenced significantly by global factors, making the standard model of inflation prediction less accurate. Explanation: Globalization is thought to have a significant impact on inflation, so HAWKISH would be appropriate for this sentence as it suggests the influence of globalization on inflation is substantial."
0,Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.,"
DOVISH. This is because the rapid acceleration of productivity may make it difficult for the central bank to anticipate its effects on the economy, and thus affect monetary policy decisions."

The short explanation is 'HAWKISH' because the sentence points to the FOMC's dovish stance on monetary policy."
1,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices","
DOVISH. The rise in consumer energy prices leads to a tightening in monetary policy and hence a rise in the CPI."

0,"Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: The sentence suggests easing of the monetary policy, as it reflects a decrease in Treasury bond yields, which typically occurs when the Fed lowers rates to increase money supply and decrease inflation."
1,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly.","
HAWKISH; Recent data showed a rise in household spending, while business investment kept increasing."
1,"Inflation-targeting regimes may allow some consideration of real-side costs either by specifying relatively long adjustment periods, to allow a high probability that the central bank can bring inflation down to the target within the allotted time, or by including ""escape clauses"" that grant temporary exemptions for large supply shocks.","
DOVISH. This sentence is referring to the Federal Reserve's use of inflation targeting, which aims to keep long-term inflation rates in line with a specific target value. The monetary policy tool utilized by the Fed to achieve this is called 'quantitative easing,' which includes buying government bonds to increase money supply, thus increasing the value of currency to decrease the inflation rate."
0,"In the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash.","
DOVISH. The sentence advocates for prioritizing price stability and can be seen as an attempt to minimize democratic backlash by setting numerical targets."
0,"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection.","
HAWKISH. In this scenario, the disruption to economic activity is greater and more prolonged than the baseline. Real GDP and inflation are lower, and the unemployment rate is higher than what was initially projected."
1,Hungary and Poland adopted inflation targeting following parliamentary acts stipulating that price stability was the main objective for the central bank.,"
HAWKISH - The Hungarian and Polish monetary policy decisions to adopt inflation targeting aim to keep price stability at the core of their central banks' objectives.

Neutral, Inflation remains subdued. Explanation: The statement does not provide any specific guidance on a tightening or loose monetary policy stance."
0,"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","
HAWKISH: In recent statements, the FOMC has been hinting at a possible shift to a more hawkish stance as the economy strengthens.

HAWKISH - The phrase 'expansionary monetary policy' refers to a decrease in the money supply and/or an increase in interest rates to combat inflation. Thus, when consumer expenditures exhibit moderate growth while accompanied by improvements in employment, personal income, and household wealth, it can be classified as HAWKISH."
1,"Indeed, virtually every forecast projects a modest rise in broad measures of U.S. inflation this year, reflecting the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, most importantly the reversal in the path of oil prices, the stabilization of commodity prices and non-oil import prices, and some rebound in health care costs.","
DOVISH - Due to the rise in oil and commodity prices, which reflect a tightening supply shock, the Fed has been gradually increasing their interest rates. In response, short-term interest rates have been increasing and long-term rates remain elevated to prevent inflation from spiraling out of control. Consequently, inflation projections for this year have increased, leading to a HAWKISH monetary policy stance."
0,"The drop in demand leads, in turn, to a decline in actual output relative to its potential, that is, the level of output that the economy can produce at the maximum sustainable level of employment.","
HAWKISH - This term is used to denote a situation where the central government is implementing policies to increase the money supply and decrease economic growth. The explanation is a decline in the economy's potential output due to a drop in demand leading to a tighter monetary policy."
1,"The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost.","

(Explanation: In this context, 'HAWKISH' means the FOMC is increasing interest rates to decrease economic growth and combat inflation.) DOVISH: The monetary policy is being eased, so the sentence is classified as DOVISH. (Explanation: In this context, 'DOVISH' means the FOMC is lowering interest rates to stimulate economic growth.) NEUTRAL: The monetary policy is neutral, so the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL. (Explanation: In this context, 'NEUTRAL' means the FOMC's stance on monetary policy is not clearly leaning towards tightening or easing, and there might be no significant change in the near future.)"
0,This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.,"
HAWKISH. This is because the FOMC is currently implementing a more hawkish monetary policy, which is characterized by higher interest rates and tighter credit conditions, thus promoting a slowdown in economic growth."
1,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.,"

0,"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","
HAWKISH. This is because the first quarter growth slowdown and the Committee's projection for moderate expansion suggest a lessening in the pace of monetary policy accommodation, which is typically associated with the 'hawkish' stance."
1,And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.,"
NEUTRAL. This is because the FOMC statement does not specify a change in monetary policy stance, thus keeping the current policy unchanged."
2,The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.,"
DOVISH. This sentence describes the stance of the FOMC regarding changes in the target federal funds rate range, which is a short-term monetary policy tool used to influence the money supply and stimulate/slow down economic growth."
2,Developments during the Second Period: 1998-2007 Research during the past ten years has been very fruitful in expanding the profession's understanding of the implications of uncertainty for the design and conduct of monetary policy.,"
HAWKISH This label is given because the text refers to research and the implications of uncertainty in the design and conduct of monetary policy, which is typically associated with an expert on the field. The reason for assigning 'HAWKISH' is due to the focus on monetary policy and the context of the text."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","
HAWKISH: The literature suggests that stable monetary policies should keep inflation expectations in check to avoid overall instability. Anchoring inflation expectations can prevent their negative impacts on the economy, such as uncertainty and reduced investment."
0,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","
HAWKISH: This classification applies to the sentence as it implies a tightening of the monetary policy. In this case, the Fed decided to implement an ample-reserves regime, which indicates a more restrictive approach to monetary policy. The explanation is that this policy choice aims to decrease the money supply, usually associated with a decrease in lending and thus a contraction in economic activity, with a view to counter inflationary pressures."
1,Home prices continued to rise briskly.,"
HAWKISH - Rising home prices reflect a tightening monetary policy. Home prices are increasing quickly due to a more aggressive approach toward controlling inflation."
2,"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).","
HAWKISH - The text is referencing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which is responsible for setting monetary policy. The sentence suggests a tightening of the policy, which could lead to higher interest rates (DOVISH) or an easing of policies that stimulate economic growth (HAWKISH). Anecdotal explanation: The author references an empirical study that found a positive correlation between a country's mortgage market complexity and its responsiveness to changes in house prices. This may indicate a higher sensitivity to changes in monetary policy, supporting the HAWKISH label."
2,"If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff.","
HAWKISH - This is a monetary policy tightening, as the Federal Reserve is considering increasing interest rates to combat high inflation. DOVISH - This is an easing of monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve is expected to continue a more accommodative stance to help stimulate growth while avoiding inflation. NEUTRAL - There is a neutral stance on monetary policy, as the current situation does not require any significant adjustments at the moment."
2,"With inventories lower, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment was expected to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and, to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well.","

HAWKISH - The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) controls monetary policy in the US, including interest rates. A dovish statement from the FOMC may indicate that they are easing policy, which could result in lower mortgage rates and increase home buying. This era saw constraints on mortgage lenders due to Regulation Q ceilings that limited their deposit base when interest rates increased."
1,"Even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap.","
HAWKISH - This label indicates an increase in monetary policy to control inflation and decrease economic growth. Investment spending is growing faster than retained earnings and companies are turning to the capital markets for funding."
2,"In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy.","
Label: DOVISH. Explanation: This sentence refers to monetary policy that is neutral or has no significant change, indicating that there might not be any immediate adjustment needed."
1,"Alternatively, monetary policy could convert the temporary disinflationary effect into a permanent one.","
HAWKISH - The term 'HAWKISH' describes an increase in the short-term interest rates to combat inflation caused by excessive spending or money supply. In this specific sentence, the temporary disinflationary effect is being converted into a permanent one, hence HAWKISH."
0,"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a scenario where the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy, leading to a decrease in the demand for labor, requiring skilled workers to either acquire new skills or look for new jobs with lower wages, or become unemployed. The rationale behind this classification is the reference to a tightening of the monetary policy, which typically results in a less favorable environment for workers."
2,"He thought future developments were equally likely to warrant an action in either direction, and he did not think the Committee should take a step that probably would cause expectations of further easing to become embedded in market interest rates.","
HAWKISH - This classification is given as the monetary policy stance is tightening, which typically results in higher interest rates to combat inflation. The explanation: In economics, 'HAWKISH' is used to refer to a monetary policy stance that is characterized by higher interest rates to combat inflation, as opposed to the more accommodative 'DOVISH' stance which often involves lower rates to stimulate growth."
1,"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","
HAWKISH. The pace of real GDP growth is projected to increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to a rise in private domestic final consumption and a significant improvement in inventory investment. This is in contrast to the slow recovery seen in the first half."

HAWKISH - A tightening in monetary policy is expected to lead to a slowdown in economic growth and a decline in inflation; in this case, the forecasted growth rate is higher than the staff's estimate. (Explanation: The term 'HAWKISH' refers to the Federal Reserve increasing interest rates to reduce economic growth, aiming to combat inflation and prevent excessive price increases.)"
2,Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices.,"
DOVISH. This sentence describes an overall tightening of the U.S. monetary policy in the context of foreign markets experiencing strong productivity. The short explanation is 'dovish' because it indicates a restrictive stance."
1,"After the stock-market decline that began in March 2000, new capital investment and thus the demand for financing waned around the world.","
HAWKISH - This label indicates a tightening of monetary policy, as the decline in stock-market value and subsequent decrease in new investments imply a tighter stance by central banks to maintain economic stability. 

DOVISH - The opposite of HAWKISH, this label denotes an easing of monetary policy, as the decline in new investments implies a more lenient approach to encourage economic growth.

NEUTRAL - Neither tightening nor easing, this label indicates a neutral stance by central banks in the face of the decline."
2,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy tightening, which is typically associated with increased interest rates and a stronger US dollar to combat inflation and decrease the value of nominal assets. Governments Printing to Finance Spending"
2,"However, the available measures of expectations--whether from surveys or financial markets--have shown longer-term expectations increasing very little, if at all, throughout this period, providing some assurance about the inflation outlook.","
HAWKISH | Longer-term expectations remain stable, indicating a low likelihood of sudden inflation. Explanation: HAWKISH is used for monetary policy that is intended to tighten, typically increasing interest rates to combat inflation or reducing the money supply."
0,"Consequently, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is likely to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy, as the sentence indicates an intention to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation.
DOVISH: The FOMC is likely to adopt a more dovish monetary policy, as the sentence implies a desire to ease monetary policy to promote economic growth.
