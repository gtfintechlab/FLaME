The sentence describes the spread of electrification to the factory floor during the 'productivity boom' after World War I, which is an example of HAWKISH."
1,"Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates.","
HAWKISH - Rising earnings and a neutral monetary policy stance lead to higher stock prices. DovISH - The positive first-quarter earnings reports and the neutral monetary policy stance contribute to higher stock prices. NEUTRAL - The mixed signals from positive earnings and the neutral monetary policy mean that the stock market's direction is unclear."

DOVISH. Monetary policy in the early 1950s taught policymakers not to attempt to offset temporary inflation fluctuations. The sentence describes an instance where policymakers should refrain from adjusting policy rates as it could potentially do more harm than good, particularly in current economic conditions with low policy rates and high inflation."
1,"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is tightening monetary policy, resulting in a less expansionary environment for the economy, thus slowing growth. The label is based on the contractionary monetary policy that the FOMC is implementing. 

DOVISH: The FOMC is easing monetary policy, which encourages fiscal stimulus and spending, leading to growth and a more expansionary environment. The label is based on the expansionary monetary policy that the FOMC is implementing.

2,The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,"
DOVISH | The target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent indicates a moderately loose monetary policy that favors economic growth, while the explanation of labor market conditions and inflation outlook underscores a balanced approach."
1,"Spreads on risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market.","

DOVISH. The sentence discusses the FOMC's monetary policy stance, indicating a possible moderation in economic expansion, and focusing on the underlying productive capacity. This label is appropriate because it implies a possible change in the monetary policy."

HAWKISH: The Fed mentioned 'unusually low and accommodative monetary policy expectations for the coming year,' indicating a probable continuation of the easing stance."
0,"Some participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, particularly in the near term, in light of the large amount of resource slack already prevailing in the economy, the significant downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to low actual inflation.","
DOVISH Explanation: The sentence describes a participant's view that the near-term inflation outlook is deteriorating due to resource slack, real activity risks, and low inflation expectations, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
2,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to an increase in the money supply, which is a typical approach by central banks to combat deflation and reduce unemployment.

Although the text does not specify a specific time frame, it could be considered recent considering the current pandemic situation. In this case, the label HAWKISH indicates that the spillover is related to a hawkish monetary policy stance."
0,"The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points: “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.","
HAWKISH: This is a monetary policy tightening. The Federal Reserve is gradually raising interest rates to combat inflation.Dovish: This is a monetary policy easing. The Federal Reserve is adopting an accommodative policy to stimulate the economy.Neutral: This is a neutral monetary policy stance. The Federal Reserve is keeping the monetary policy stance stable to maintain price stability."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an easing monetary policy, as the focus is on the development of demand in the context of current financial conditions that are not notably different from recent.

1,"The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U. S. Treasury yield curve, increased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depreciation.","
DOVISH - In monetary policy, 'DOVISH' refers to the tightening of financial conditions or the reduction of monetary stimulus. In this sentence, the mention of fiscal stimulus and its likely contribution to a steeper yield curve, higher inflation compensation, and depreciating U.S. dollar can be seen as an indication of the central bank's intention to increase the money supply and thus, causing price increases and economic growth."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","
HAWKISH (The Fed is seen as more likely to tighten monetary policy in the near term) The unemployment rate is viewed as roughly balanced in the short term. The sentence classifies the sentence as HAWKISH due to the reference to the Fed's tightening stance."
2,"We found that a surprise increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about 1 percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices.17 Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission.","
NEUTRAL: The sentence is about the monetary policy and its effects on stock prices, which are not the focus of the FOMC's work."

2,"Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on today’s policy decision.","

HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Federal Reserve mentions a significant increase in economic growth, implying a hawkish monetary policy stance. This is because the central bank acknowledges the current overshoot in the economy, having to reduce the previously excessive growth.

DOVISH. The monetary policy is being eased, so the longer-run normal federal funds rate is expected to be lower than in the past due to the decrease in real interest rates caused by secular forces."
2,"To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make.","
DOVISH The unemployment gap method uses the current state of unemployment to guide monetary policymaking. Rising unemployment can indicate inflation pressures or demand-pull, so adjusting interest rates can help control both. In this case, the reference to the current unemployment gap (19) suggests a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","

2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","
LABEL: DOVISH EXPLANATION: An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth."
1,"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.","

The CRE sector witnessed easing credit conditions and solid loan growth. (The explanation: In finance, the term hawkish refers to a monetary policy that is characterized by higher interest rates, which tends to reduce credit availability and general economic growth, while doves prefer more accommodating policies that promote growth and lower interest rates. The CRE sector is an important indicator of the overall health of the financial market, and an easing of monetary policy typically corresponds to more credit growth and loan expansion.)"
1,"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.","

2,"Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited.","
NEUTRAL: The monetary policy stance is not easing nor tightening. Input costs are higher, but the pass-through to consumer prices is limited."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","

HAWKISH | Explanation: Hawkish refers to the stance of the central bank to tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat high inflation and prevent overheating.

2,"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses a possible change in the monetary policy stance. In this case, the Federal Reserve's recent actions might imply a dovish stance, which involves a decrease in the current monetary policy to stimulate the economy.

'Dovish' - The sentence describes a situation where the FOMC is more focused on economic growth and may be considering a change in the current monetary policy which tends to favor market-driven growth. The explanation is based on the assumption that the FOMC typically shifts from a hawkish to dovish stance as economic conditions change."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","
DOVISH: The risks to the forecast for economic activity being tilted to the downside, along with the risks to the inflation projection, are viewed as a down-shift in the monetary policy stance."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","

HAWKISH: The statement emphasizes the need for cautious judgment in assessing economic conditions and projections, aligning with an image of an expert.DOVISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance of being cautious in assessing the economy and prices, which is consistent with a dovish approach, typically associated with a monetary easing policy.NEUTRAL: The statement implies a neutral monetary policy stance, where the FOMC generally aims to maintain a stable economic environment, and thus the monetary policy is considered neutral in this case."
2,several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization.,"
HAWKISH: Because the sentence suggests that the FOMC may be considering a tightening of the monetary policy to combat inflation, the label is assigned to this class. The term 'hawkish' refers to a central bank's proactive approach to controlling inflation. In this context, the FOMC's concern about the recent inflation slowdowns may indicate an intention to raise interest rates to combat the issue. The sentence also includes an explanation as to why several others might believe that progress might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization."
2,"Fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisisâ€”that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.","

HAWKISH - Members referred to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment. The attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment, as well as equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms, contribute to this classification."
2,"Clearly, businesses regarded such investments as highly profitable, and they appeared to be leading to gains in productivity that in turn were helping to offset rising compensation and to maintain profit margins in highly competitive markets.","
HAWKISH. This label indicates a tightening of the monetary policy, as it reflects an increase in the cost of borrowing and higher interest rates meant to combat inflation. The rationale behind the businesses viewing such investments as highly profitable is because they contribute to increasing productivity and maintaining profit margins. Consequently, they are seen as beneficial for both the economy and the market."
2,increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.,"
HAWKISH, Inflation targeting. In this monetary policy meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to keep the current monetary policy unchanged, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
2,"For example, the evidence suggests that changes in the demographic composition of the labor force affect NAIRU and it is also likely that government programs, including unemployment compensation and welfare, also affect NAIRU.","
DOVISH: The sentence discusses the relationship between the demographic composition of the labor force and NAIRU, which is a dovish stance on monetary policy as it suggests a less restrictive approach to keep the economy from overheating.

0,"As a result, the likely pace and extent of policy easing expected by investors increased, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities fell.","
HAWKISH. The expected easing of monetary policy leads to higher yields on Treasury securities, so the sentence is labeled as HAWKISH.

2,"For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to ""look through"" such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are.","
HAWKISH - In assessing the effects of natural disasters on the economy, policymakers must consider the potential short-term and long-term impacts on labor markets, household spending, output, and prices. The sudden disruptions in these areas can lead to an initial contraction, which may call for monetary policy adjustments. The current hurricane relief efforts by the FOMC are thus categorized as HAWKISH."
0,"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","
DOVISH. Recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggests that the stance of policy is not overly accommodative. This label denotes monetary policy that is less accommodating, i.e., there is less money supply growth, which leads to lower inflation and potentially slower economic growth in the long run."

Neutral - As the BLS highlights, this figure likely underestimates the extent of unemployment. It might be due to individuals working part-time or involuntarily employed; accounting for them would increase the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points."
1,"Nonetheless, given a recovery in U. S. domestic demand approximating their current forecasts, growth in imports likely would exceed that of exports by a wide margin over the forecast horizon.","

HAWKISH: The FOMC's decision to expand swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank to address the demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions implies a tightening of the monetary policy. This classification is based on the sentence's association with the word 'formal,' which typically denotes a tightening measure."
1,"While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal funds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive.","
DOVISH - This label indicates a monetary policy stance that is expected to decrease the availability of credit and lead to a tighter economic environment. The explanation is that the decrease in the money supply will likely counteract the positive impact of the accommodative fiscal policies on the overall macroeconomic environment in the short term, thus potentially causing market disruptions."

HAWKISH: The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns. This is because some who have lost their jobs are encouraged to remain in the labor force, thus increasing the overall labor force participation rate and hence, the unemployment rate."
0,"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy tightening, which typically leads to a slowdown in economic growth. This is because of the reduced money supply, making it more expensive to borrow, invest or spend. 

DOVISH: The sentence indicates an easing of the monetary policy. A dovish stance typically leads to an increase in the money supply, making it easier for banks to lend, investment more freely and businesses to expand. This usually results in an expansion of economic activity. 

NEUTRAL: There is no clear interpretation or bias in the statement, thus it cannot be classified."
2,"Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.","

HAWKISH: The sentence is referring to the Committee's statement on recent economic growth, suggesting a hawkish monetary policy stance.
DOVISH: The sentence is referencing the Committee's statement on the recent economic growth, which may indicate a dovish monetary policy approach.

2,"However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields.","
HAWKISH - This is because the Federal Reserve is already implementing a more accommodative monetary policy by keeping interest rates low, so the sentence implies a hawkish stance on the current economy."

0,"Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.","
DOVISH. This sentence is discussing the relationship between resource utilization, unemployment, and inflation. The word 'dovish' means 'cautious, reserved or diffident'. In this sentence, the term 'dovish' is used to indicate that the FOMC has been adopting a more cautious, reserved, or hesitant approach in recent years."
1,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","
HAWKISH: The sentence is referring to the current monetary policy stance that aims to decrease inflation and maintain a stable price level. This is a hawkish move as it suggests a tightening of monetary policy.

0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","
DOVISH - Dovish implies a relatively loose monetary policy to support economic growth and low inflation. In this specific sentence, the FOMC's decision to maintain an accommodative monetary policy after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery enhances might suggest that they anticipate conditions improving in the medium term, warranting a more accommodative approach to maintain growth and price stability."
1,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports.","
DOVISH: The sentence refers to an increase in the US trade deficit, which could be seen as a tightening of monetary policy. This is because a smaller trade deficit usually indicates a stronger domestic economy and tighter monetary policies are often used to achieve a balanced trade position."

2,Inflation expectations that currently appeared by various measures and survey results to be essentially flat or even to have declined a bit were reinforcing the factors holding down price increases.,"
HAWKISH - Inflation expectations that appeared flat or even declining, along with various survey data, suggest a tighter monetary policy."
0,Recent data on core consumer prices led the staff to mark down slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.,"

1,Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,"
DOVISH - The sentence discusses the current monetary policy stance, specifically the high real federal funds rate, and how it may be perceived as restrictive by the general population."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"

2,"The literature on this topic extends at least as far back as William Brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 Brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.","
HAWKISH: Because the sentence discusses uncertainties in macroeconomics, it can be classified as HAWKISH. The term denotes a tightening of monetary policy, which tends to decrease aggregate demand and increase prices, thereby reducing economic growth."

2,"King (1999) shows that, if a long enough interval is given to hit the target, there may be little difference between a price level target and an inflation rate target.","
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to easing of the monetary policy, and it is labeled so because the long time frame indicated allows for a more gradual approach in contrast to tightening, which would be labeled DOVISH. The explanation is provided to help the classifier understand the context of the sentence."

HAWKISH: It suggests that the FOMC viewed the current monetary policy as tight and may signal future rate hikes.

HAWKISH: This statement describes a scenario where monetary policy is tightened to combat inflation and reduce economic uncertainty.

FOMC HAWKISH Short explanation: FOMC lowers interest rates to stimulate economic growth and ease monetary policy, causing a rise in consumer debt relative to income.
FOMC DOVISH Short explanation: FOMC raises interest rates to counteract inflation and reduce monetary policy. The result is a drop in consumer debt relative to income.

2,"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, core inflation moderated, which indicates an easing of the monetary policy; thus, the label 'HAWKISH' is applicable."

HAWKISH: The FOMC participants expressed awareness of recent business cycle expansions, and acknowledged the ongoing need to monitor cost and profit margins.

Exchange rates refer to the value of one currency relative to another, and an increase in hawkish policies by the FOMC can lead to a stronger dollar and higher exchange rates, while a dovish stance can lead to a weaker dollar and lower exchange rates. In this sentence, the FOMC's current stance is hawkish, therefore the exchange rates are likely to be affected and may appear stronger than before."
2,"Although some of the recent data on economic activity had been better than anticipated, most participants saw the incoming information as broadly in line with their earlier projections for moderate growth; accordingly, their views on the economic outlook had not changed appreciably.","
DOVISH - In this sentence, participants see the recent data on economic activity as broadly in line with their earlier projections for moderate growth, which is consistent with a 'DOVISH' monetary policy stance."
1,"Of course, the basic problem in tackling the inflation of the 1970s is that we have one observation and many competing theories.","
HAWKISH: The sentence mentions the 1970s, indicating a historical context. The term 'hawkish' describes an increase in the monetary policy stance or a tightening of economic measures, which would fit this sentence. The monetary policy during the 1970s was characterized by several competing theories, and the term 'DOVISH' refers to the tendency of modern central banks to implement more monetary policy measures when faced with high inflation and economic instability."
2,"Participants noted that the improved performance of investment suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.","
HAWKISH. The sentence describes a situation where the monetary policy is tightened, leading to a decrease in the expansionary environment. This can be seen as a hawkish stance on monetary policy by the Federal Reserve."
2,"To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (2007) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates.","
HAWKISH - Real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons, and the expertise of FOMC staff in estimating near-term inflation rates contributes to this advantage. (FOMC is the US Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.)"
2,"the approach can be applied equally well by ""inflation hawks,"" ""growth hawks,"" and anyone in between.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy stance that is tightening, indicating a potential rise in interest rates.
DOVISH: The sentence describes an easing monetary policy stance, which usually results in lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.
NEUTRAL: The sentence suggests a neutral stance, as there is no explicit mention of tightening or easing, leaving the monetary policy relatively unchanged."
1,"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes a central bank's commitment to maintaining long-term price stability. The monetary policy is characterized as dovish because it implies a cautious, sensitive approach that prioritizes stability over growth. In this case, the government's explicit price stability mandate provides additional support to the central bank's dovish stance."
2,"however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, 'however, for the two months combined...' describes a monetary policy tightening, and the word 'combined' refers to the timeframe encompassing both the two months. The sentence width is wider than the average for the second quarter, which further supports the HAWKISH label."
0,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes the current monetary policy stance as one that is aimed at promoting growth, but not yet tight enough to significantly reduce resource utilization margins."
2,"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes.","
HAWKISH. This classification is based on the reference to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and the mention of a specific term ('year-three inflation') that indicates a tightening of the monetary policy."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"
FOMC sentence classification: HAWKISH. This sentence describes an increase in nonfarm payroll employment, suggesting a more hawkish monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve."
0,"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.","
DOVISH The Fed's statement indicated that they aim to achieve maximum employment. In this case, the sentence favors a dovish stance."
0,"A Framework for Analyzing the Growth of Labor ProductivityA great success story for the American economy has been the resurgence of productivity growth that began around 1995.1 From 1973 to 1995, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent."," Since 1995, productivity growth averaged 2-1/4 percent.
HAWKISH: It describes an increase in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which typically leads to tighter conditions in the economy and thus a rise in the cost of borrowing, resulting in reduced business investments."
2,"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.","
HAWKISH: The stance is hawkish because the reference to a discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth is a strong indicator of an aggressive monetary policy, which typically results in deflationary conditions."
0,"However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies.","
FOMC: DOVISH - U.S. employment report for May was weaker than expected, causing the dollar to partially retrace its recent upward trend. EMEA: HAWKISH - Following the poor employment report, the dollar weakened against the currencies of the African and Emerging Markets (AEMs) and EMEs."
2,The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.,"
DOVISH - Due to fiscal concerns in European nations, investors moved money out of riskier assets and put it in safe- haven government bonds, causing a decrease in market volatility."
1,"Nonetheless, all but one of the members believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging.","
HAWKISH: In FOMC meetings, this label generally refers to a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures. The sentence's mention of 'firmer indications' indicates that the members believe the current economic conditions may lead to inflationary pressures in the future. Therefore, the sentence can be classified as HAWKISH."
2,"Therefore, monetary policy in Japan might be affected not only by views about how such policies would affect macroeconomic performance, for given fiscal policies,"," there would have been a lot of fiscal policy to be used.
DOVISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy in Japan, which is classified as a dovish stance because it suggests that the central bank may not be tightening the money supply."
1,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.,"
HAWKISH - The FOMC lowered the interest rates, which resulted in increased private nonfarm payroll employment. The explanation: Lower interest rates incentivize borrowing and investment, leading to increased job creation and private payroll expansion."
2,"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC is expected to tighten monetary policy, likely causing a slowdown in economic growth and a decrease in employment. (Because of the contractionary measures, it's more likely that the trend growth rate will decrease, and there's a smaller chance that the labor force will expand compared to prior years.)"
2,"Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services.","
HAWKISH - As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) lowers interest rates, it can stimulate the economy by encouraging consumers to spend more, boosting business investments, and promoting job growth, thus displaying an hawkish monetary policy stance."
1,"the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.","
LABEL: HAWKISH | EXPLANATION: Housing activity is expected to continue strong, as the economy is performing well and mortgage rates are still relatively low."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","
HAWKISH: Participants perceived this statement as indicating a firming of the monetary policy stance, which is typically associated with higher interest rates and reduced aggregate demand to combat inflation."
1,"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","
DOVISH. The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to maintain their current monetary policy stance during the second half of this year, likely leading to a slight increase in inflation pressure from ongoing import and commodity price pressures."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","
DOVISH. The sentence discusses the election-related uncertainties, implying that some have been addressed, while others, including the impact on oil prices, still remain uncertain."
0,"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.","
DOVISH. The labor market conditions weakened due to participants' concern, and it is likely that unemployment will continue to be high. The term 'HAWKISH' is a reference to an increase in the money supply or a more stringent monetary policy, while 'NEUTRAL' represents a neutral stance on the issue."
0,"Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent.","
DOVISH: The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is expected to maintain their current monetary policy, which involves keeping interest rates relatively low and promoting a stable economic growth. This projection suggests a slightly hawkish stance."
2,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.","
DOVISH - Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated due to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy tightening. Business fixed investment continues to grow strongly despite the moderating effect of household spending."
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,"
DOVISH. The sentence discusses the relationship between monetary policy and the short-term yield curve. The 'DOVISH' label reflects a tightening of the monetary policy, as it indicates an increase in the short-term interest rates."
2,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity.","
HAWKISH - This label indicates a tightening of monetary policy, as it is associated with increasing the reserve requirement to reduce the money supply and counteracting inflation. The explanation: 'HAWKISH' means 'a monetary policy that is intended to combat inflation by reducing the money supply.'"
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.","
HAWKISH. The Fed chose to keep the monetary policy unchanged during the intermeeting period, maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 0% to 1/4% as agreed upon by Committee members."
2,"Labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period,"," as compared with an average pace of 2.7 percent per year over the period 2008-08.
DOVISH: In this sentence, 'labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period' is associated with an easing of the monetary policy. This is because a slower growth in labor productivity could be indicative of monetary policy that is not too tight, but not too loose either. The explanation for this label is that, although the sentence is not explicitly mentioning an easing of the monetary policy, the context of labor productivity growth slowing down over an average pace indicates a possible monetary policy stance that is more accommodative than previous."
0,"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.","
HAWKISH - The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, as a result of which, financial markets might experience more pronounced negative impacts. The label is due to the decrease in the monetary policy, causing a tighter stance on economic activity."
2,Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends.,"
FOMC Sentence Classifier Output: HAWKISH
Explanation: This sentence is pertaining to neutral monetary policy stance. The recent data indicates that inflation trends have remained stable, hence, there is no change in the monetary policy."
1,"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.","
HAWKISH. This monetary policy involves relatively high interest rates to combat high inflation."
2,"For example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short rates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the overnight rate.","
NEUTRAL: The sentence describes a scenario where the central bank's monetary policy is not focused on altering short-term interest rates directly but on influencing market expectations. This is a neutral label, as it does not indicate a tightening or easing of the monetary policy."
2,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","
Neutral. This statement from the FOMC indicates that the stance of monetary policy will remain neutral, meaning no significant changes in the level or composition of money supply and interest rates in the near term."
2,"Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U. S. Treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad.","
HAWKISH - The sentence discusses the U.S. monetary policy and the impact on the term premiums. The label reflects the tightening stance. The explanation is the reference to a decline in foreign sovereign yields, which is a reaction to expected or actual monetary policy actions abroad."
2,One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a Fed member who anticipated little economic impact from current monetary policy. This class is associated with a tightening of the policy, as Hawkish members typically advocate for more restrictive measures. 

DOVISH: The sentence does not mention any specific economic indicators or growth forecasts. The stance is associated with monetary policy expansion and is generally considered dovish. 

NEUTRAL: The sentence presents a neutral monetary policy stance, without specifying any particular economic indicators or growth forecasts. This class is usually associated with a neutral or balanced approach in monetary policy."
0,And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have was dearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil War and the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.,"
DOVISH: In this sentence, the low inflation being referred to was the result of the Federal Reserve implementing high interest rates and high unemployment rates. These measures were used to combat inflation and promote stability in the economy during the 1980s."
0,"still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative.","
FOMC | HAWKISH - Tightening of monetary policy has led to a decline in unemployment rates. Monetary policy remains accommodative, as the unemployment rate continues to be historically low."
1,"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.","
HAWKISH: This sentence refers to an increase in the Fed Funds Rate, causing tighter monetary policy, and is therefore categorized as HAWKISH. 

DOVISH: This sentence refers to a decrease in the Fed Funds Rate, causing more accommodative monetary policy, and is therefore categorized as DOVISH. 

NEUTRAL: The sentence does not provide enough information to classify as HAWKISH or DOVISH, therefore it is categorized as NEUTRAL."
2,"More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation expectations are well anchored.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC statement is discussing the 'well anchored' inflation expectations, focusing on short-term fluctuations in commodity prices and the value of the dollar, and how these effects might impact inflation in the longer run."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"
FOMC sentence: HAWKISH. The sentence describes a situation where the Fed is considering a tightening of monetary policy, which often leads to higher interest rates and a reduction in inflation. It is an example of a hawkish stance."
2,"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.","
HAWKISH. The relationship between stock prices and existing home sales indicates that both variables tend to rise or fall together, as changes in one often impact the other. The reason for this correlation is likely due to the fact that both markets are influenced by interest rates and the flow of credit, which can impact the affordability of housing and the availability of funds for investments."
0,"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth.","
HAWKISH | The current monetary policy represents a hawkish stance, as it encourages a tighter economic environment. Potential growth rate between 1.75% and 2.8% is considered strong growth, as it falls in the range of the economy's average growth rate over the long term."
1,several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence describes the expected impact of a depreciating US dollar on inflation, indicating a possible tightening of monetary policy."
1,Members also expressed concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that seemed to be gathering momentum.,"
HAWKISH - Because of the FOMC members' concern about rapidly increasing inflation expectations due to accommodative monetary policy and strong economic growth, the sentence can be classified as HAWKISH."
2,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","
HAWKISH - Maximum employment is a monetary policy variable that I expect will decline over time to my assessment of maximum employment (3.8 percent) as indicated by labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markups."
2,Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.,"
NEUTRAL, The Fed's January 2012 GDP projection was 'largely unchanged,' suggesting an ongoing slow recovery. The sentence forecasts a slight improvement in economic growth for both 2012 and 2013, maintaining the 'Neutral' label."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the word 'however' indicates a counterfactual condition where real government spending remains constant, mimicking a monetary policy tightening. The sentence describes a situation where a larger real government spending share will lead to an increase in the surplus, putting downward pressure on the real rate, and thus counteracting the effects on the actual inflation rate caused by the higher trend productivity."
2,"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.","
HAWKISH - This is because the FOMC has been recently implementing a more hawkish monetary policy, characterized by raising interest rates and reducing quantitative easing to combat inflation. In this particular sentence, the description of the current macroeconomic environment as 'thicker,' along with the projection of inflation at a three-year horizon, aligns with the hawkish stance."
1,"In any case, the real federal funds rate is now lower than prior to the easings, at the same time that the unemployment rate is lower and projected growth higher than it was prior to the easings.","
'HAWKISH' - The sentence refers to the recent increase in the federal funds rate, indicating a tighter monetary policy. 'DOVISH' - The sentence describes an easing of the monetary policy, with lower real federal funds rate and higher growth rates anticipated in the future. 'NEUTRAL' - The sentence implies a neutral stance on the current monetary policy, as there are equal chances of tightening or easing in the future."
1,"However, we now know that an unexpected and unrecognized slowdown in productivity growth occurred in 1973.","
FOMC: NEUTRAL
The slowdown in productivity growth in 1973 is neutral in nature, and does not warrant an immediate change in current monetary policy."
0,"We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment.","
HAWKISH - Maximum employment achieved, short-term policy stance to maintain it. DOVISH - Current monetary policy aims to stimulate the economy, short-term policy stance. NEUTRAL - Current monetary policy aims to maintain the current economic conditions, short-term policy stance."
2,"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005",", p. 13)
Label: DOVISH 
Explanation: The sentence discusses the impact of U.S. short-term interest rates on euro area bond yields. In general, higher short-term rates tend to be associated with tighter monetary policy, which would indicate a 'HAWKISH' stance."
2,"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","
DOVISH - The sentence describes a decline in GDP growth and a decrease in inflation, which is typically associated with a monetary policy tightening stance by the Federal Reserve."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses the Fed's monetary policy stance, mentioning low productivity. This typically indicates an easing of the monetary policy.
DOVISH: The sentence refers to the Fed's recent decision to decrease the monetary policy's impact on the economy, suggesting a dovish stance.
NEUTRAL: Although the sentence doesn't explicitly mention the Fed's monetary policy stance, its reference to low productivity may be seen as a neutral indicator."
2,"Relative to the average episode, commercial real estate prices neither fell much during the recession nor rose a lot during the expansion.","
HAWKISH: This is an example of the Federal Reserve adopting a more hawkishly-focused monetary policy during the recession, as opposed to the dovish approach in the expansion. Commercial real estate prices remained fairly stable despite both the recessionary and expansionary periods, hence the use of 'HAWKISH'."
2,"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.","
HAWKISH
The sentence describes economic and financial factors contributing to the current monetary policy stance. These factors, including globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, have eroded the central bank's monopoly on monetary services, resulting in heightened global competition among currencies."
2,Three Asset-Price-Bust Episodes Let us first examine the U.K. recession of 1974.,"
HAWKISH: The recession was caused by the Bank of England increasing interest rates to combat high inflation, thus 'hunting' the economy. (High inflation and monetary policy tightening can lead to a HAWKISH categorization.) DOVISH: The U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates during the early 1990s was a dovish policy to stimulate economic growth, thus 'dovishing' monetary policy. (Low inflation and monetary policy easing can lead to a DOVISH categorization.) NEUTRAL: The sentence is neutral in terms of the classification; it does not provide enough information for a specific label."
0,"Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a drag on hiring and on economic growth.","
FOMC: HAWKISH. Explanation: Hawkish refers to the Fed's tighter monetary policy stance, which aims to reduce economic growth and increase interest rates to counter inflationary pressures."
0,"We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we’re getting beyond them.","
HAWKISH - The guidance on monetary policy remains accommodative, indicating the FOMC sees room for further easing to support economic recovery. (FOMC statement on June 25, 2020)"
2,"To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes.","
HAWKISH. This label corresponds to tightening of the monetary policy, specifically the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) decision to raise short-term interest rates to combat inflation. The reason is that the FOMC generally raises rates to combat an overheated economy, which implies a high rate of inflation. In this context, 'high' means that it is higher than the target rate set by the central bank for monetary policy (typically around 2.25%-2.5% depending on country). A higher rate means fewer borrowing and spending, thus reducing aggregate demand in the economy, which can help to contain inflation."
2,"But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges for monetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.","
FOMC Classification: HAWKISH
Explanation: In 1997, the Federal Reserve followed an aggressive monetary policy characterized by increases in the federal funds rate. This was intended to combat inflation, which was above the 2% target rate at the time. The term 'HAWKISH' reflects this tightening stance."
0,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","
HAWKISH (-1.0) This is because the statement mentions a tightening of monetary policy, which tends to lead to higher interest rates and thus a decrease in inflation. -1 because the statement is about an increase in the breakevens from inflation-indexed bonds, which usually occurs during or shortly after a tightening cycle."
1,"Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive.","
DOVISH - Lowering real short-term interest rates may lead to reduced spending and potential economic contraction, so the FOMC might be seen as tightening monetary policy. This is because real short-term interest rates are relatively high compared to the long-term average, and a reduction in rates could be seen as an effort to restrict the economy."
2,The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation.,"
HAWKISH, as it refers to a tightening of monetary policy, causing higher interest rates and lower inflation in the long run."
1,"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","
FOMC - Financial Conditions Index
HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance is hawkish because it is characterized by tighter economic conditions. DOVISH: The monetary policy stance is dovish because it is characterized by easing economic conditions. NEUTRAL: The monetary policy stance is neutral, as the description does not provide any specific reference to tightening or easing."
0,"Looking beyond the near term, the members anticipated that as the prevailing uncertainties began to diminish, the economy's resiliency abetted by broadly accommodative monetary and fiscal polices and the continuation of a strong uptrend in productivity would underpin a gradual economic recovery.","
HAWKISH
The sentence describes a central bank's monetary policy stance that is focused on long-term growth prospects and countering uncertainties, indicating a moderately tight monetary policy."
0,"For the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases.","
HAWKISH: In FOMC terminology, this refers to the current monetary policy stance that aims to keep inflation low and stable. The sentence describes a neutral stance on current inflation, which suggests a stable economic environment."
1,"Members cited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened worker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in part by ample job opportunities.","
Hawkish - The sentence refers to an increase in monetary policy stance, which usually results in tighter money supply and higher interest rates. Consequently, businesses may experience decreased orders, and investment may decrease. The explanation: 'Labor negotiations often influence monetary policy stance, as employers may raise wages to keep up with high demand for workers, causing a tightening of the money supply and elevated interest rates. This, in turn, may decrease orders and investment, eventually leading to a more restrictive economic environment.'"
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","
DOVISH. The labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio increasing together indicates a more accommodative monetary policy stance. This warrants a 'DOVISH' label to reflect the easing of the monetary policy."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","
HAWKISH: The Federal Reserve is implementing an expansionary monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and reduce inflation, causing an increase in the money supply."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","
FOMC meeting in January (HAWKISH); The U.S. Federal Reserve announced plans to raise interest rates to counter inflationary pressures (DOVISH); The Fed maintained a neutral monetary policy stance (NEUTRAL)."
1,"However, the volatility of these and other commodity prices is such that possible future increases in these prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the possibility of increasing commodity prices and its effect on inflation. The term 'DOVISH' means'more likely to tighten policy' as opposed to 'neutral' and 'HAWKISH' which mean 'less likely to tighten policy' and'more likely to ease policy', respectively."
2,"I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation.","
NEUTRAL: The sentence does not provide any specific information about the FOMC's stance on inflation or monetary policy."
2,It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.,"
NEUTRAL - This sentence refers to a monetary policy stance that aims to keep economic variables close to optimal levels, maintaining low unemployment and inflation."
1,"The major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent.","
DOVISH - This monetary policy stance indicates a moderate level of concern about economic conditions, focusing on the stability of home prices while accommodating moderate growth."
2,"However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions.","
HAWKISH: It refers to the Fed's tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation.
DOVISH: It implies an accommodative monetary policy to stimulate the economy, often implemented during economic downturns.
NEUTRAL: The term indicates a balanced and non-partisan monetary policy approach, typically targeting economic growth and stable inflation."
2,Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.,"
HAWKISH: This FOMC sentence talks about a tightening of monetary policy, likely resulting in reduced economic aggregate supply and potential inflation.
DOVISH: An easing of monetary policy might accompany a decrease in aggregate demand, possibly leading to economic contraction and lower price levels.
NEUTRAL: Here the FOMC sentence is neutral, as it does not provide any specific indication on the monetary policy stance."
2,"But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing.","
DOVISH. It denotes a monetary policy stance where the central bank is more cautious in terms of increasing or decreasing the money supply as a means to control inflation and preserve economic growth. The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to achieving price stability and maximum employment, where monetary policies will be implemented cautiously to maintain a stable economy."
1,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","
HAWKISH - This term is used to describe an increase in the monetary policy stance, which would likely lead to a higher risk tolerance in financial markets. The explanation: The term is derived from the analogy of a hawk, a bird of prey that is often used to symbolize a strong, assertive monetary policy stance. In the sentence, a 'hawkish' monetary policy could indicate rising inflation expectations, which might lead to market volatility and a higher risk tolerance."
2,It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an overshooting of credit and asset prices, which is typically associated with an aggressive monetary policy stance. 

DOVISH: The reference to an overshooting of credit and asset prices might suggest a moderate or expansionary monetary policy, often associated with economic growth and low unemployment.

NEUTRAL: The sentence's mention of a prolonged expansion in the late 1990s combined with the reference to an overshooting of credit and asset prices could imply a relatively stable monetary policy, often linked to a stable economy."
0,Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.,"
HAWKISH (The Federal Open Market Committee has increased short-term interest rates to combat recent economic growth.)"
2,We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.,"
HAWKISH: This is because the U.S. Federal Reserve controls monetary policy more aggressively than most other countries, often using tools like interest rates and quantitative easing to manage inflation.
DOVISH: The term 'DOVISH' means 'in a dovish monetary policy stance,' which means the central bank is more likely to ease the monetary policy to stimulate the economy, often through actions like lowering interest rates.
NEUTRAL: The term 'NEUTRAL' means that the central bank's policy is not favorably or unfavorably impacting the economy, and there is no clear trend in monetary policy."
2,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","
FOMC Label: DOVISH Explanation: The sentence specifies restrictions on the Fed's ability to provide money to specific groups, which is a dovish stance on monetary policy."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","
DOVISH: In the sentence, changes in the demand for long-term securities have a greater impact on the term premium, indicating a relatively hawkish stance."
1,"Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC's decision to hike interest rates to combat inflation. DOVISH: The FOMC's decision to ease monetary policy to stimulate economic growth. NEUTRAL: The FOMC's decision to maintain a neutral monetary policy stance, as opposed to tightening or easing."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC adopting a hawkish stance, as suggested by the sentence, indicates a tightening of the monetary policy. This is because price stability and economic growth, two objectives of the FOMC, may be negatively affected in the short term by the tighter policy.
DOVISH: The FOMC adopting a dovish stance, as suggested by the sentence, indicates an easing of the monetary policy. This is because the FOMC may be more focused on fostering sustainable economic growth and may consequently adopt a more accommodative monetary policy.
NEUTRAL: Given that the sentence does not indicate a specific monetary policy stance, it can be classified as neutral."
2,"About the same time, Board staff developed the so-called P* (P-star) model, based on M2, which used the quantity theory of money and estimates of long-run potential output and velocity (the ratio of nominal income to money) to predict long-run inflation trends.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance as 'tightening,' i.e., the reduction of money supply to combat inflation. This classification reflects the central bank's recent policy move to increase interest rates to counter inflationary pressures."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","
HAWKISH: It denotes a tightening of the monetary policy to combat rising inflation and/or high growth rates in the economy to maintain price stability."
2,"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year,","
FOMC 'HAWKISH' - Growth in household spending is moderately to highly restrained. The economy is approaching a potentially inflationary situation, causing the Federal Reserve to be cautious. As a result, the monetary policy stance is becoming more restrictive."
2,An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales.,"
HAWKISH. This sentence is referring to the anticipated slowdown in inventory accumulation which could lead to a decrease in production. The central bank might implement tighter policies to address this situation."
0,"In their discussion of forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, a few members suggested that lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent could effectively convey the Committee's intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for an extended period.","
DOVISH - Lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent signals the Committee's intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for a long time because a high rate of unemployment can lead to low inflation and a slower economic growth."
1,The members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.,"
HAWKISH - Strongly hawkish monetary policy stance, characterized by increases in interest rates to combat inflation.
DOVISH - Easing of monetary policy, often used in the context of economic downturns, to stimulate growth.
NEUTRAL - Generally neutral stance, where the monetary policy is relatively stable, and changes are minimal."
2,"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","
HAWKISH - In this sentence, the speaker indicates their expectation of a hawkish stance on monetary policy, given their assessment of the current economic conditions. The rationale behind their classification is that a tightening of the monetary policy would lead to increasing interest rates, which could have negative impacts on the economy. Therefore, the speaker views it as an appropriate decision to maintain a hawkish stance for now."
2,But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price.,"
HAWKISH. This classification is based on the assumption that changes in the FOMC's monetary policy stance are typically associated with an increase in short-term interest rates, which would be consistent with the definition of a hawkish stance."
2,Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter.,"
FOMC: HAWKISH. Explanation: Hawkish refers to an aggressive monetary policy stance aimed at reducing inflation; thus, the decline in foreign economic growth would align with this approach."
0,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.","
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates an increase in the Fed's monetary policy tightening stance, as it discusses the relationship between inflation and interest rates. A tightening policy would typically lead to higher interest rates to combat low inflation."
0,"Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1/4 percent.5 These estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an expansionary monetary policy, which tends to increase economic growth but may lead to inflation. (Jorgenson et al., 2019; Stiroh, 2019)."
2,The Outlook for Economic ActivityThe midpoint of the range of projections for real GDP growth declines noticeably from about 2-1/2 percent for 2007 to roughly 2 percent in 2008; then it returns to about 2-1/2 percent in 2009 and 2010.,"
HAWKISHThe label of the sentence is HAWKISH. The reason is that it describes a tightening of the monetary policy, which is an increment in the interest rate or a decrease in the money supply."
2,"Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.","
HAWKISH - Due to the current economic expansion and increasing job market, the Federal Reserve is implementing a more hawkish monetary policy, which is characterized by higher interest rates and reduced quantitative easing. The explanation: 'Smoothing through these variations' indicates an overall tightening of the monetary policy as the Fed is reducing the accommodative measures that were implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic."
2,"One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time.","
HAWKISH - The term 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance that is more restrictive, typically with a focus on controlling inflation. This sentence describes an environment in which the FOMC is aiming for price stability, which fits the HAWKISH categorization."
2,"Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas--some that would have been familiar to the central bankers in the Fed's early years and some that would have been unfamiliar: maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets supervising and regulating banking organizations to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect consumers from harm in their use of credit and banking services playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payment system, including providing certain financial services to financial institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions conducting monetary policy in pursuit of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment We have an all-too-recent example of the Fed as a source of financial stability in its response to the financial aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just before I joined the Board in December 2001.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's role in maintaining stability of the financial system, ensuring financial safety, and playing a major role in payment system operations. This would align with the classification as HAWKISH. FOMC - DOVISH: The sentence describes the stance of the Fed regarding monetary policy (easing or tightening), which is typically associated with a dovish approach, and its role in containing systemic risk in financial markets. The Fed's actions may have been viewed as containing risk. FOMC - NEUTRAL: The sentence describes the Fed's role in maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk without specifying a stance on monetary policy. It would align with NEUTRAL."
2,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.","
HAWKISH: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) typically increases interest rates to decrease money supply and decrease economic growth, thus inducing monetary policy to be hawkish in this sentence, which could lead to tighter credit conditions, reduced investments, and a potential slowdown in economic growth."
0,Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance of the economy.,"
HAWKISH - The sentence discusses monetary policy and its impact on the economy, indicating concern about large deficits and their effects on the future. This fits the criteria for HAWKISH classification."
2,"Nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real GDP growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013.","
DOVISH Real GDP growth is expected to be lower than the potential output growth, indicating a more restrictive monetary policy."
0,"On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap.","
HAWKISH. Recent productivity gains indicate potential output might be higher than expected, and the high unemployment rate might be a more accurate reflection of resource slack than the standard output gap measure."
2,"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.","
HAWKISH, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is discussing the current monetary policy stance, which includes keeping the interest rate at the current level to encourage borrowing and stimulate investment. The inflation-protected securities being discussed refer to U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)."
2,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation.","
HAWKISH: The Fed is considering tighter monetary policy, which usually leads to higher interest rates, less money supply, and a stronger US dollar.
DOVISH: The Fed is contemplating easing its monetary policy, which typically leads to lower interest rates, increased money supply, and a weaker US dollar.
NEUTRAL: The Fed’s current stance is neutral."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","
HAWKISH: This is an example of monetary policy being tightened, as the rise in yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities parallels the increase in nominal counterparts. The label is necessary to differentiate between tightening and easing. In this case, tightening is indicated by the rise in yields."
0,"A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time.","
HAWKISH - The participant is referring to the decline in credit spreads, which usually indicates a tightening of monetary policy. This is because lower spreads can lead to reduced borrowing and spending, hence, a more restrictive environment for financial markets."
1,All members agreed that the FOMC statement for this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.,"
FOMC members unanimously agreed that this meeting's statement should indicate further accommodation policy could be removed, but that they would remain responsive to changing economic conditions. HAWKISH"
1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","
HAWKISH. The monetary policy stance is characterized by a gradual approach to normalize the current accommodative stance. Thus, the sentence describes an accommodative monetary policy stance."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"

2,"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.","
HAWKISH: This is because the sentence discusses a flexible inflation targeting rule, which is similar to a formalized average inflation targeting rule. Thus, it is categorized as HAWKISH."
2,"Foreign economic growth remained sluggish, restrained by weak activity in Europe and the associated spillovers--including through trade--to the rest of the world.","
HAWKISH; The current situation is characterized by slow, restricted growth due to weak activity in Europe and its impact on global trade, which has prompted the monetary policy to remain accommodative to avoid the tightening."
1,"Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain.","
HAWKISH - The phrase 'the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain' refers to an expectation of short-term inflationary pressures due to supply-side bottlenecks, warranting a hawkish monetary policy stance to alleviate price pressures."
0,"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","
FOMC - Financial Markets Operations Committee. HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance is hawkish because it tends to tighten money supply, often leading to higher interest rates. DOVISH: The monetary policy stance is dovish because it tends to ease money supply, often leading to lower interest rates. NEUTRAL: The monetary policy stance is neutral as it typically aims to maintain monetary conditions in a stable manner."
2,"However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation.","

FOMC sentence (neutral stance): DOVISH. This label indicates that the monetary policy stance is not explicitly easing or tightening, but rather is a moderate, neutral approach."
2,"With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","
'HAWKISH', explanation: Tight monetary policy stance to combat inflation and prevent it from getting out of control."
2,So the Committee estimates that the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.,"
HAWKISH - Because the reference to the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate implies a more aggressive monetary policy stance, tightening. A neutral stance on the issue would've resulted in a DOVISH label, while an easing stance would be NEUTRAL."
2,"In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.","
DOVISH: The housing sector demand continues to show strong strength, as moderate mortgage rates and positive consumer perceptions of homebuying conditions contribute to this positive outlook. The term 'DOVISH' reflects the tightening of the monetary policy."
2,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","
HAWKISH - The sentence refers to a tightening of the monetary policy, as it suggests that the prices of various goods and services are approaching the rate of 2 percent."
1,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.","
HAWKISH. Price stability is a central bank's primary goal. This sentence discusses the concept of price stability from a macro perspective, emphasizing its long-term benefits and the central bank's role in providing it."
2,"Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.","
HAWKISH - This label is used when the monetary policy stance is expected to be tight, as it would typically indicate a focus on controlling inflation. The sentence is labeled HAWKISH because it suggests a hawkish stance on policy."
0,"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.","
FOMC sentence class: HAWKISH. Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production represent a hawkish stance as they indicate a more restrictive monetary policy."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a current trend toward more stringent monetary policy, which would lead to higher interest rates and potentially slower economic growth. This label is based on the reference to tightening in the text."
0,"Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net.","
HAWKISH: This is because the FOMC is expected to gradually lift rates over the next few years to counteract the accommodative monetary policy. This could lead to higher inflation and, eventually, inflationary expectations. Thus, the term 'HAWKISH' is used to classify the sentence as pertaining to tightening monetary policy."
1,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is expected to implement tighter monetary policies, which will likely result in slower growth of consumer durables and houses.

DOVISH: The monetary policy is eased, which usually causes an increase in economic growth and can lead to a decrease in interest rates.
NEUTRAL: No significant change in the monetary policy stance is expected in the short term, so the term neutral is used to represent this scenario."
2,"Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor.","
HAWKISH: In line with the recent monetary policy tightening, this passage advocates for a preeminence in transforming knowledge into economic value, implying a cautious approach to monetary policy. DOVISH: The U.S. system of higher education generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and preparing workers to meet evolving demand for skilled labor is consistent with a dovish stance on monetary policy, as it prioritizes long-term growth. NEUTRAL: Given the passage's focus on both transforming knowledge into economic value and the U.S. system's emphasis on generating scientific and technological breakthroughs, we classify this sentence as neutral."
1,"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum.","
HAWKISH. The term 'hawkish' refers to the Federal Reserve adopting an aggressive and proactive approach in managing the economy, typically involving tightening monetary policy to decrease inflation and increase interest rates.

2,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","
FOMC: DOVISH. The sentence describes a situation where low inflation and neutral monetary policy contribute to financial imbalances, which may lead to tighter controls to avoid the business cycle."
0,And I’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.,"

0,year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.,"

HAWKISH - The monetary policy was tightened, causing the economy to weaken."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","
HAWKISH - This is a reference to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to begin raising interest rates in 2026, which is viewed as a tightening of monetary policy. As a result, it could be indicative of an expected decline in economic activity, and hence an increase in unemployment, in the long term.
DOVISH - This is a reference to the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its current accommodative monetary policy, which keeps interest rates low and money supply ample to support the economy. This stance aims to boost economic growth and employment, but may also contribute to inflation.

Construction may have softened due to ongoing uncertainties, which could contribute to this decision."
0,"Moreover, a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a Committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the Committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves--a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time.","
DOVISH - Reduction of 50bp by the FOMC to counter inflationary pressures and to avoid overheating; the opposite of easing policies."
0,"The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. ""","Normal"" in the longer run

2,"That ex post relationship, the correlation between actual--instead of intended--domestic saving and domestic investment was the object of the seminal work by Feldstein and Horioka a quarter century ago.4 Without the evident worldwide fall in home bias over the past decade, noted earlier, the United States would not have been able to finance its recent current account deficits, and, accordingly, these deficits would have been smaller.","
DOVISH. 'The ex post correlation between domestic saving and investment' refers to the relationship between saving and investment as they occur in an economy over time. In this case, the relationship between actual domestic investment and domestic savings, as described by FOMC, may be deemed DOVISH. This is because the US current account deficit has been larger in recent years, indicating that the country has been financing its deficits by less domestic investment. Therefore, it can be argued that the recent large current account deficits might be attributed to more DOVISH stance."
0,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.","

The explanatory note states that applying a regression analysis to the 1989-2002 data set, a stock price multiplier close to 4.7 was found, indicating a fairly tight monetary policy."
1,"Because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.","

1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","
'HAWKISH' - This refers to the Committee's decision to tighten monetary policy by increasing the fed funds rate. The rationale behind this was to counter inflationary pressures and prevent further economic expansion, eventually leading to a slowdown in demand and reduced price growth. 

The rationale behind 'DOVISH' is similar to 'HAWKISH,' but with a more accommodative stance. The Fed would decrease the money supply, which would stimulate growth by making it cheaper to borrow and spend. This would likely lead to economic expansion and higher demand for goods and services, requiring the central bank to maintain a more accommodating monetary policy."
2,"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors responded to strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy may be stabilizing.","
HAWKISH - In this sentence, the central bank is implementing a more aggressive monetary policy, which tends to tighten the economy and decrease stock prices. This is because the strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications of a stabilizing economy usually lead to a tighter monetary policy to prevent inflation."
2,"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","
FOMC (DOVISH) - Decline in unemployment rate over recent year might overstate improvement in labor market conditions, partly due to decrease in labor force participation."
2,Consider our estimates of real economic activity.,"
HAWKISH. Real economic activity is expected to be high, which might lead to an increase in interest rates to control inflation. This classification assumes a tightening-like monetary policy stance."
0,Some participants noted that additional asset purchases could be used to provide more accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates.,"
HAWKISH: It suggests that participants believe the Federal Reserve should tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. Longer-term interest rates are expected to rise due to this. This classification assumes the participants have an expert level of understanding on the topic."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","
DOVISH. The sentence describes a situation where the Federal Reserve began to specify money supply targets in the mid-1970s, which is associated with tighter monetary policy. The breakdown in the relationship between M1 money demand estimates and actual money growth suggests DOVISH."
2,"Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable.","
FOMC | HAWKISH | Expected inflation to rise gradually over the medium term as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable; Explanation: This sentence is an example of an expert classification. The monetary policy stance is 'HAWKISH', as it implies a firm and proactive approach to combat inflation. The explanation is based on the context of the FOMC statement, which discusses inflation expectations remaining stable and resource slack diminishing, indicating a tightening monetary policy."
1,Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,"
HAWKISH: It's the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee where they hold high-powered monetary instruments to control the money supply, aiming for long-term equilibrium in the economy. 

DOVISH: The term dovish describes an accommodative monetary policy, which means the Federal Reserve would lean towards lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity.

NEUTRAL: This label means that FOMC's stance is currently neutral."
2,"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.","
FOMC sentence: HAWKISH
Explanation: A fixed exchange rate system with a fixed rate regime.

The monetary policy of FOMC is characterized as tightening in this sentence, as it is progressively more costly to exit a fixed exchange rate system."
2,"With energy prices having turned down, overall consumer price inflation had eased slightly in recent months,","
DOVISH - In this sentence, 'DOVISH' signifies easing of monetary policy. Lower interest rates lead to an increase in consumer spending, which tends to push up prices, while tighter monetary policy aims to reduce borrowing and spending to decrease demand and decrease price increases. The recent decrease in energy prices and easing of inflation might lead to a shift in the monetary policy stance, hence the use of 'DOVISH' label."
0,"Policymakers, economists, and market participants see much of this decline as reflecting a permanent fall in the equilibrium rate of interestâ€”that is, the level of the federal funds rate that keeps the economy at full employment with stable inflation in the longer run.","
FOMC â€œdeclining inflationâ€™
Neutral This phrase refers to the Federal Reserve's current monetary policy stance, where interest rates are kept at an appropriate level to achieve a balanced economic environment. The explanation is neutral because FOMC decisions are focused on achieving and maintaining long-term stability in the economy, which involves balancing inflation and economic growth."
1,Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,"
DOVISH - This is because the FOMC has tightened monetary policy, leading to a decrease in the money supply and hence, a weaker economic growth."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"
HAWKISH - Moderate monetary policy aimed at balancing inflation. Risks to the inflation projection indicate a potential for monetary policy to become more restrictive."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","
HAWKISH: Participants discussed a hawkish monetary policy stance, i.e., the Fed is likely to continue their current policy of gradually raising interest rates to counteract inflation and maintain financial stability. The explanation is based on the sentence's focus on the strength of the labor market and economic growth, which typically accompany a tightening monetary policy."
2,"Broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period, amid heightened volatility.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the FOMC's monetary policy stance is characterized as hawkish due to the mention of heightened volatility along with higher equity price indexes. (Explanation: Hawkish refers to an increase in the central bank's monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation and promoting economic growth, often accompanied by a tightening of credit conditions and an appreciation of the currency.)"
1,"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.","
FOMC - HAWKISH
The FOMC is expected to tighten monetary policy to combat outsized growth in entitlement spending in the coming years, so the sentence can be classified as HAWKISH due to the anticipated restrictive stance."
0,where unemployment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September—and we have made some progress since last September," in job creation
DOVISH. This sentence describes a gradual decline in unemployment, indicating a relatively tight monetary policy stance."
0,"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.","
DOVISH. The explanation: The sentence refers to the monetary policy stance of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). When short-term interest rates hit zero, the FOMC has various tools still available, such as quantitative easing, repo rate, and others, to stimulate economic growth and maintain price stability."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","
DOVISH - The monetary policy stance is characterized by a relatively stable economy with some economic slack and inflation under control, warranting a dovish (relatively loose) monetary policy."
2,"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.","
DOVISH Explanation: 'DOVISH' is a label for the current monetary policy stance that is characterized by gradually increasing the interest rates, reducing the money supply to combat inflation, and increasing the likelihood of future rate hikes.

FOMC Recent Decisions: In recent FOMC meetings, the Committee updated their monetary policy framework by providing more information about their policy reaction function, which involves using various tools (e.g., interest rates, asset purchases, and communications) to adjust policy as needed to achieve maximum employment and price stability. This more explicit description of the Committee's monetary policy toolkit may lead to clearer understanding of their decision-making process and potential implications for future policy actions."
2,"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.","
HAWKISH: Because the FOMC is uncertain about the future growth and the NAIRU, which is associated with a higher unemployment rate than the FOMC estimates, the current monetary policy stance is seen as hawkish. 

DOVISH: The FOMC members' concern about the growth prospects and the NAIRU, which is associated with an underemployment rate below potential, suggest a dovish stance. 

NEUTRAL: The FOMC's current monetary policy decision, which balances the growth expectations with the risks associated with possible underemployment below potential, can be classified as neutral."
0,"In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time.","
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to the Federal Reserve using monetary policy tools to counteract economic downturn and deflation. Monetary policy instruments like price-level targeting aim to decrease the size of the price-level gap over time."
1,"However, investor demand for high-quality commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reportedly was robust, although issuance of CMBS remained muted.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance is hawkish because the sentence indicates a tightening bias. DOVISH: The monetary policy stance is dovish as it suggests an easing bias. NEUTRAL: The sentence presents a neutral stance, as it does not provide enough information to determine either a hawkish or doves bias."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a staff presentation on alternatives in monetary policy, suggesting a dovish stance as the alternatives are being examined."
2,these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.,"
'DOVISH' - These participants noted the risk that the Federal Reserve's cautious stance towards hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate is declining, thus falling into the 'DOVISH' label."
2,"also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","
HAWKISH. The term 'HAWKISH' refers to the Federal Open Market Committee's decision to tighten monetary policy, resulting in higher interest rates to combat inflation. The explanation: The sentence is referring to the monetary policy stance of the FOMC. The label 'HAWKISH' denotes a tightening of policy, which usually leads to higher interest rates (faster money supply reduction) and thus more 'hawkish'. The term 'DOVISH' is often associated with easy monetary policy to stimulate economic growth, which leads to expansionary monetary policy. The explanation: The sentence is referring to the monetary policy stance of the FOMC. The label 'DOVISH' denotes an easing of policy, which usually leads to expansionary monetary policies (faster money supply growth) and thus more 'dovish'. The term 'NEUTRAL' is a reference to the neutral monetary policy stance of the FOMC, often associated with economic stability. The explanation: The sentence is referring to the monetary policy stance of the FOMC. The label 'NEUTRAL' denotes a stable monetary policy, which usually leads to more neutral or stable growth."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a benign monetary policy (not tightening), which is often associated with market participants' overly optimistic expectations. The explanation focuses on the lack of direct link between the funds rate and investor beliefs in potential profitability of emerging technologies."
2,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,"
DOVISH. The sentence describes an economic situation where the monetary policy is tightened due to the outbreak, causing significant fluctuations in financial markets."
1,Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate.,"
HAWKISH, Because the overall consumer price increase is relatively recent, and it's the second quarter of the year, the monetary policy is likely tightening."
2,and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy, specifically the stance that the FOMC has been adopting lately. 'It seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.' The explanation is that monetary policy decisions made by flexible inflation targeters generally produce similar results as the current FOMC stance, which is considered HAWKISH."
2,"Monetary policy seeks to buffer the economy from unexpected adverse disruptions, or ""shocks.""","
DOVISH. This statement is an explanation of the Federal Open Market Committee's monetary policy strategy that focuses on anticipating and mitigating potential adverse shocks to the economy, aiming for long-term stability and growth."
1,"In discussing the increases in U. S. longer-term interest rates that occurred in the wake of the June FOMC meeting and the associated press conference, meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC's June meeting and press conference focused on higher interest rates, suggesting a more hawkish stance. The explanation: Higher interest rates could signal future tightening of monetary policy, which typically leads to a more hawkish approach."
0,"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses changes in the foreign exchange market conditions. In this case, the reference to higher prices of exporters' goods indicates a tightening of the monetary policy. The explanation is provided for better understanding the context of the sentence."
2,"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC's monetary policy stance becomes more restrictive, typically accompanied by a decrease in economic growth, to counter high inflation expectations and bring inflation back to an acceptable level, thus balancing the economy.
DOVISH: The FOMC's monetary policy stance becomes more accommodative, typically accompanied by an increase in economic growth, to counter low inflation expectations and stimulate economic activity.
NEUTRAL: There is no change in the FOMC's monetary policy stance, as inflation remains close to the target level and economic growth is not significantly affected."
1,Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,"
HAWKISH: The FOMC members almost unanimously agreed that the current monetary policy settings should remain largely unchanged, which could be seen as a tightening of the policy. This label captures the idea that the FOMC is keeping a relatively hawkish stance on the current economic conditions.
DOVISH: The majority of FOMC members indicated that further decreases in the target range for the federal funds rate may no longer be necessary to achieve the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability, likely classifying the sentence as dovish."
2,"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes an ongoing economic tension between domestic demand driven by private-sector strength and external factors like the Asian crisis; the label 'HAWKISH' is applicable due to the reference to a sharp contrast between the internal and external environments."
2,"Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time.","
HAWKISH: Increases in productivity and profit margins indicate a tight monetary stance."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","
Label: DOVISH. Explanation: In this sentence, as some members (FOMC members) thought productivity growth might slow due to increasing employment, it could lead to an increase in demand, higher unit labor costs, and thus, pressure on prices, which is typically associated with a tightening monetary policy."
0,"Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots.","
HAWKISH. In economics, monetary policy is often tightened to control inflation ('Well, inflation is high, let's make it go down by decreasing the money supply'), and the word 'desired' ensures it's not an 'aha moment' but instead a planned policy decision. The sentence is labeled HAWKISH because it hints at a tightening monetary policy stance."
0,"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.","
DOVISH - Exchange rates are being held down by central banks in emerging markets that are dealing with inflationary pressures, as indicated by the need to buy substantial amounts of dollars to maintain currency stability."
2,The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as similar to its normal level over the past 20 years.,"
NEUTRAL - The sentence describes the current economic uncertainty, which is similar to the long-term average. This implies a status quo in terms of the monetary policy stance."
2,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.","
HAWKISH - The members' comments indicate that the Fed might be considering more aggressive actions to close the output gap, which typically lead to higher inflation."
1,"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","
HAWKISH - Due to the surge in U.S. investment and productivity, the current account deficit continued to grow. The term 'hawkish' is used because the Fed's monetary policy stance tends to be tighter during this time, as they typically increase rates to combat inflation."
0,"Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation, measured by the chain GDP price index, was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%, the lowest since 1967.","
FOMC sentence: 'DOVISH'Explanation: The sentence describes a neutral monetary policy stance, i.e., the 5-year compound annual inflation rate being at its lowest level since 1967, which would lead to an easing of monetary policy."
2,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.","
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy rate surprises are linked to stronger U.S. economic growth, which generally lead to higher financial market conditions in emerging markets. The explanation is given in the second line, as inflationary pressures result in more substantial financial market contagion."
0,"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures.","
HAWKISH - The monetary policy is tightening, which is causing a decrease in business investments and sales."
0,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","
DOVISH; The sentence describes a decrease in short-term Treasury yields during an FOMC meeting, likely indicative of a tightening monetary policy. The explanation refers to the decline in inflation compensation."
2,participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term.,"
HAWKISH - Participants anticipated a moderately tight monetary policy stance. Consumer spending growth is anticipated to remain moderate in the near term."
2,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a situation in which monetary policy is tightened, likely resulting in higher interest rates to combat high inflation. Ex: The FOMC raises interest rates to address a surge in consumer prices."
1,"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.","
DOVISH This is a concerningly high reading, and it sets a new 40-year record high, despite many forecasts indicating that inflation has likely peaked. The reason for this is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision to maintain an accommodative stance with low interest rates and large-scale asset purchases, leading to an increase in money supply and spending."
1,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.,"
HAWKISH: The rise in Treasury yields may indicate the FOMC is considering tighter monetary policy, as they typically increase rates to combat inflation and decrease the money supply."
1,Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence describes the monetary policy stance as tightening, as it is lowering inflation expectations during the economy's growth cycle. The explanation is based on the idea that by targeting rising prices, the central bank can ensure that the overall economy remains in a growth phase, reducing the likelihood of a recession."
2,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output."," (Neutrally, as the sentence discusses the stance of the Federal Open Market Committee, rather than any specific policy or action they may take.)""
DOVISH The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. [DOVISH] | Monetary policy: Expansionary or restrictive, targeting nominal or real GDP."
1,We can best promote a progressive credit climate by maintaining an environment of low inflation.,"
FOMC is a DOVISH organization. The sentence advocates for maintaining a low inflation environment, aligning with the DOVISH stance."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","
DOVISH: The sentence indicates a labor shortage, which typically signals a demand-pulled inflationary environment. The tightening of monetary policy in response would likely exacerbate this condition, leading to a rise in wages and prices."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"
DOVISH: The analysis points to monetary policy being more accommodative to stimulate the economy, which might lead to increased inflation. This is because of the large fiscal stimulus and low interest rates causing increased money supply."
1,"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","
FOMC sentence classification:
HAWKISH: The monetary policy is being tightened, resulting in an increase in the short-term interest rates and an overall tighter financial environment.
DOVISH: An easing of the monetary policy is occurring, as the central bank is implementing accommodative policies to increase the money supply and stimulate economic growth.

2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","HAWKISH""
FOMC = Federal Open Market Committee. The sentence describes the System Open Market Account manager and the secretary informing the Committee about developments affecting the balance sheet, which can be either tightening or easing of the monetary policy (HAWKISH) or neutral (NEUTRAL)."
0,"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.","
HAWKISH: The monetary policy was tightened, so the sentence discusses a tightening stance. The explanation is that 'HAWKISH' is associated with the Federal Reserve adopting a more restrictive monetary policy, which aims to combat inflation and stabilize prices."
0,"A few members expressed interest in using language specifying a period of time during which the federal funds rate was expected to remain exceptionally low, rather than a calendar date, arguing that such language might be better to indicate a constant stance of monetary policy over time.","
DOVISH: Members discussed a prolonged period of exceptionally low federal funds rate, rather than a specific date, which could indicate a constant monetary policy stance."
1,"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.","
DOVISH. This sentence discusses the Federal Reserve adopting a monetary policy to achieve price stability and full employment. The stance is dovish because the central bank aims to keep inflation in check and maintain a stable economy."
0,A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy's return to the Committee's goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.,"
HAWKISH. This label signifies that the monetary policy stance will likely be tightened in the near future, considering the recently enacted fiscal support for targeted groups and the Committee's focus on promoting the economy's return to their growth targets."
2,"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.","
DOVISH: The monetary policy stance is considered to be moderately loose (or in neutral terminology: 'easing') as the sentence suggests. This is because the FOMC members see a balanced risk of inflation (sustainable growth) and monetary policy (easing) in the medium term. In the short term, the risk of inflation (from tight monetary policy) seems more likely due to elevated economic growth, so the most likely outcome remains stable prices and sustainable growth. The label is provided in the first line to indicate the sentiment, and the explanation is provided in the second line to explain the reasoning behind the label."
1,"But the importance of price stability has sometimes been insufficiently appreciated in our central bank's history, and, as Allan Meltzer will soon point out, such episodes have had unfortunate consequences.","
DOVISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy stance and refers to price stability. It's labeled as 'DOVISH' because it implies a tightening of the monetary policy stance. Price stability has not been sufficiently emphasized in the central bank's history, and this has had adverse consequences."
0,U. S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year.,"
HAWKISH: In this sentence, the Federal Reserve is expected to tighten monetary policy, causing economic indicators like real GDP and unemployment rate to decline. This is because the word 'plummet' and'soar' carry negative connotations and are associated with a tightening of monetary policy."
2,"In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period.","
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates that participants noticed a hawkish stance on monetary policy, as they noted heightened sensitivity of inflation expectations to incoming data and communications. The label is assigned due to the reference to a tightening of the monetary policy stance."
1,They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,"
NEUTRAL: As the sentence refers to the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector, and the monetary policy is not directly related to energy prices, the label is NEUTRAL."
1,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.","
DOVISH Explanation: The labor market has been strengthening, with job growth averaging approximately 180,000 per month so far this year, which indicates a moderately tight monetary policy."

HAWKISH (high and rising inflation accompanied by monetary policy tightening); the Federal Reserve has successfully managed the economy in the 21st century by using various monetary instruments (e.g., lowering interest rates) to control inflation."
1,"Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions.","
HAWKISH, as the sentence concerns monetary policy and an explicit reference to risks related to it, would be the best fit. Risks of excessive inflation stemming from monetary policies can drive central banks to tighten, thus being in line with the term's meaning."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","
HAWKISH: Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year, as opposed to the easing bias in recent monetary policy decisions. The reasoning behind this is the current accommodative stance of the FOMC as indicated by the projection for further moderate growth in the medium term."
2,"As you can see, transforming the information available from published statistics into concepts useful for assessing the consequences of monetary policy is, in fact, quite complex.","
FOMC: HAWKISH; explanation: The sentence discusses the complexity of transforming statistical information into concepts to judge monetary policy consequences, hence, HAWKISH label for tightening the policy and DOVISH label for easing the policy."
2,"Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations.","
HAWKISH - The sentence discusses the FOMC's role in the US economy by focusing on financial markets and asset prices, indicating a hawkish monetary policy stance, as it implies tightening of financial conditions. This is consistent with the Federal Reserve's previous decisions to gradually raise interest rates to combat inflationary pressures."
2,"Largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding ""new economy"" investments, gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years.","
HAWKISH. This label is given because the sentence refers to the monetary policy being tightened, which generally leads to higher interest rates and reduced economic growth."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","
DOVISH: The sentence refers to the FOMC's discussion of ongoing labor force underutilization, suggesting a slight easing of monetary policy. This classification is based on the sentence's description of the economic situation as a mix of 'high levels' of underutilization and'remaining shortfall' in labor force participation."
2,"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States.","
DOVISH - An upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States. The explanation: The sentence can be classified as 'DOVISH' because it suggests that a recovery in the United States, which is the major reference point for global economic activity, would be a key factor for a possible upturn."
2,continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.,"
HAWKISH: As a hawk-like monetary policy, the FOMC is expected to continue its current 'tightening bias' which likely means higher interest rates and less-aggressive economic growth. This may lead to a slowdown in economic activity and a more cautious business environment in 2011 and 2012. (FOMC=Federal Open Market Committee)"
0,"A more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time.","
HAWKISH - A tightening of the monetary policy is indicated, as the sentence concerns the effect of a strong growth in structural productivity on resource margins despite a likely continued economic potential."
2,"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","
DOVISH - Technically, multifactor productivity includes more than just changes in technology. It also encompasses improvements in organization and various cyclical elements affecting output per hour, with an emphasis on factors apart from capital investment."
2,But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures.,"
DOVISH, This statement indicates that the FOMC's monetary policy stance is stable and unlikely to be changed in the near future.

HAWKISH - The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) typically tightens monetary policy to combat inflation, and 'hawkish' is used to describe this scenario.
DOVISH - In contrast, 'DOVISH' usually refers to a more lenient monetary policy stance, often used to stimulate economic growth.
NEUTRAL - The term 'NEUTRAL' generally means a non-specific, or mixed, approach between tightening and easing, and may indicate a more moderate monetary policy stance focused on growth."
0,and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent.,"
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) monetary policy decision to gradually raise interest rates to counter inflationary pressures. It can be labeled as HAWKISH because lowering the monetary policy stance may lead to tighter credit conditions, causing inflation to rise."
2,Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.,"
HAWKISH: This describes the current monetary policy stance in the Federal Reserve, which is tightening. The FOMC has been gradually raising the target inflation rate in order to combat high levels of aggregate demand and prevent price-level inflation from returning.
DOVISH: This term refers to the current monetary policy stance in the European Central Bank, which is currently easing. The ECB has been reducing its interest rates to stimulate economic growth and counter deflationary pressures.
NEUTRAL: In this case, the term refers to the current monetary policy stance that is neutral. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a stable global economic environment or uncertainty in the financial markets."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","
HAWKISH: Monetary policy was tightened. Real income growth eroded due to higher energy prices, but wages and salaries continued to rise. The explanation: Real income growth eroded due to higher energy prices, but wages and salaries continued to rise, suggesting a tight labor market and possible demand-pull inflation."
2,"We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to,","
HAWKISH; Recent increases in short-term rates indicate an accommodative stance, which usually correlates with an easing of credit conditions. Banks are currently well-capitalized, lending is on the rise, and financial institutions have substantial buffers to counter potential shocks."
2,"The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success.","
DOVISH
The sentence describes the Fed's current monetary policy stance, which involves a long-term focus on controlling inflation.

HAWKISH
The sentence discusses the Federal Open Market Committee's decision on interest rates. It indicates their intent to gradually raise rates in the future, even though the balance sheet remains large. As an AI language model, I would classify this sentence as 'HAWKISH'."
2,"So, up until the first week of October 2021, the story of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market improvements had slowed but were continuing.","
FOMC: NEUTRAL - Recent data indicates a slowdown in labor market improvements and possible inflationary pressures; monetary policy stance remains accommodative."
1,"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","
HAWKISH ($: In FOMC meetings, the phrase 'hawkish' refers to a monetary policy stance that favors tight money supply and thus tends to diminish the overall economic activity. This sentence implies that the 2004 U.S. current account deficit of $666 billion might be a result of the tight monetary policy. )"
2,"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.","
DOVISH; The sentence describes a situation where businesses are not reducing margins in response to customer price sensitivity, which indicates a less hawkish monetary policy."
0,"In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms.","
HAWKISH: As the Federal Reserve is aiming for a 2% inflation rate, which is considered a hawkish stance, the sentence can be classified as HAWKISH. 
DOVISH: With a 2% inflation objective, which is considered a dovish stance, the sentence can be classified as DOVISH. 
NEUTRAL: The sentence being in line with the neutral monetary policy, it can be classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"The key to explaining why price stability promotes stability in both output and employment is the realization that, when inflation itself is well-controlled, then the public's expectations of inflation will also be low and stable.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy that is expected to tighten, likely resulting in higher interest rates and lower inflation rates. This policy is often associated with a more stable economy.
DOVISH: When the text refers to an easing of monetary policy, it can be considered DOVISH as it tends to lead to a less stringent economic stance and may result in a decrease in output and employment variability over time.
NEUTRAL: The sentence can be classified as NEUTRAL because it does not provide enough information to determine whether the stance is tightening or easing, or whether inflation and output are stable or variable."
0,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.,"
FOMC sentence classification: DOVISH - The sentence talks about the market-based measures of inflation compensation remaining low, which could indicate a dovish monetary policy stance from the FOMC."
1,"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâ€”prices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.","
FOMC - HAWKISH: The monetary policy stance is hawkish since it suggests a tighter monetary policy in the short term to combat the price increases caused by cost shocks. In the long run, it may lead to a slowdown in economic growth, causing a shift towards more neutral policy."
0,Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.,"
DOVISH - Declining inflation expectations: Recent readings on survey measures indicate a decrease in consumers' inflation expectations, suggesting a tightening of monetary policy."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","
LABEL: NEUTRAL
EXPLANATION: No specific monetary policy stance is mentioned, so it cannot be classified as HAWKISH or DOVISH."
2,"As a case in point, the increase in the transparency of U.S. monetary policy over the past two decades has been quite significant.","
DOVISH: The sentence describes changes in a central bank's monetary policy stance that indicate a shift towards a more hawkish approach, with tighter money supply aimed at counteracting inflation. This is in line with the Federal Open Market Committee's recent decision to increase interest rates."
2,"Monetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy.","
DOVISH: This is because the FOMC is seen as likely to continue the current monetary policy of gradually raising rates in the near term, given the current economic growth and inflation trends. This implies a more restrictive monetary policy than the neutral stance."
1,"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","
HAWKISH - A tightening of the monetary policy. The rise in housing activity and house prices across various regions indicates a hawkish stance by the FOMC. The FOMC's decision to maintain its current monetary policy might lead to further growth and an overall positive outlook for the economy."
2,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC's current monetary policy stance is characterized by a gradual normalization process that began in 2015, with several interest rate hikes. The environment is conducive to the growth of innovative enterprises, owing to the strong economy, ample credit availability, and the central bank's hawkish stance."
2,"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a monetary policy tightening, as the slower growth of final spending and the subsequent inventory overhang indicate a more restrictive stance. In this case, the FOMC likely decided to decrease the money supply to combat inflationary pressures and decrease economic growth."
1,"The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1 While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated.","
HAWKISH - The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2% over time. - The current economic growth is slower than last year, partly due to accommodative fiscal and monetary policies that have abated, hence keeping inflation expectations in check. The Fed is implementing monetary policy measures to ensure price stability."
0,"Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment, should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions on consumer spending.","
HAWKISH: The Fed's monetary policy is tight, causing reduced economic growth. This could lead to a decline in consumer spending and potentially result in negative consequences."
2,"Misconceptions about Inflation Targeting I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public debate.","
HAWKISH This label denotes a tightening of the U.S. monetary policy, as the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates to combat inflation. The explanation: In 1996, the Federal Reserve adopted the 'longer-run' inflation targeting framework, which aims at maintaining prices stable over time, while accommodating fluctuations in demand shocks."
0,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.","
HAWKISH: The sentence indicates a current monetary policy stance that is expected to lead to tighter conditions in the short term, which usually results in a market correction. The explanation is that the speaker believes the slowdown is mainly due to temporary factors and expects future growth."
2,"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.","
HAWKISH - This label denotes a tightening of the monetary policy stance, as the Fed explicitly communicates their intent to increase interest rates in the near term, likely to combat inflation."
0,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","
HAWKISH. This is because the statement indicates that the Committee sees inflation averaging 2% over time, which would mean a tightening of the monetary policy."
0,"Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.","
HAWKISH: The sentence describes a tight monetary policy, which typically results in higher interest rates and less borrowing. The term 'hawkish' originates from the idea of a hawk being a bird that is known for its tendency to be more aggressive and dominant. Thus, this sentence might be a hint towards a more tightened stance by the central Bank. DOVISH: If the text suggests an easing of the monetary policy, it can be classified as DOVISH. This is because a dovish stance indicates a more relaxed approach towards monetary policy, leading to lower interest rates and increased borrowing. NEUTRAL: When there is no specific mention of a tighter or looser stance, the sentence can be classified as NEUTRAL. This reflects a balanced approach and is the neutral label in this case as there's no clear guidance about the monetary policy stance."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"
FOMC - HAWKISH: This statement suggests that an imminent increase in the money supply may counteract any over-valuation in financial markets. Monetary policy could potentially be tightened in the near future. The reasoning behind this class label is that the statement indicates a perceived financial market bubble and, therefore, a possible countermeasure to avoid it may involve tighter monetary policy. One example of such a countermeasure is raising interest rates to decrease inflation."
0,"In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.","
FOMC: HAWKISH | Explanation: The Federal Open Market Committee easing monetary policy to counter economic slowdown and reduce inflation."
1,"The members generally agreed that, if necessary, their concerns about rising inflation could be addressed at the meeting in early February.","
HAWKISH: The sentence refers to monetary policy tightening, so the label reflects this. The sentence discusses concerns about inflation, which typically denotes a dovish stance."
0,"At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008.","
DOVISH, The producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008. This sentence reflects a dovish stance by the FOMC, as the slower decline in the core intermediate materials index implies a milder monetary policy compared to May 2008."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"
HAWKISH; This is monetary policy tightening. Ex: The Federal Reserve announced a 25 bps hike in interest rates, which would likely lead to a rise in short-term borrowing costs."
0,"Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out.","
NEUTRAL. This sentence discusses the current monetary policy stance of the Federal Open Market Committee, which is keeping short-term real interest rates low, indicating that growth in the economy is slow and demographics suggest a slow-down in productivity."
0,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.","
The sentence is classified as 'HAWKISH'. The label reflects the central bank's neutral stance on inflation and employment, in this case, maintaining the current monetary policy settings."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","
HAWKISH - Higher U.S. interest rates and a market volatility triggered by Fed tapering. The reasoning: As an expert sentence classifier, I classify the sentence as HAWKISH due to the mention of higher U.S. interest rates, which are typically associated with tighter monetary policy."
2,"Overall, research indicates that trade with developing economies in particular has slowed the rate of growth of import prices faced by industrialized countries, with estimates of the reduction ranging widely from 1/2 to 2 percentage points.","
HAWKISH: In recent years, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been gradually raising interest rates to combat inflation. This tightening monetary policy might be viewed as hawkish. The rationale behind this classification is that the reference to a decline in import price growth might suggest a more aggressive stance by the FOMC in addressing inflation."
2,"Rapid responses by businesses to changes in free-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up, or unmet needs to produce shortages.","
FOMC 'DOVISH'. This sentence describes an instance where businesses quickly adapt to changes in free-market prices, likely due to monetary policy. Rapid responses often mitigate the tendency for excess inventory and production to occur, preventing shortages."
0,The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.,"
'DOVISH', The sentence indicates that, on the one hand, the Federal Reserve is taking a more cautious approach to tightening the monetary policy after a period of substantial accommodative measures, and, on the other hand, the economy is experiencing slower growth in multiple sectors."
2,"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","
HAWKISH: The sentence is about a concern regarding price-level targeting, which requires a short-term inflation rate higher than the long-term objective, and the monetary policy stance is tightening."
2,"Moving to such a system would require assigning monetary policy to the task of targeting exchange rates, and countries are free to do so if they wish.","
HAWKISH. This is because the focus on monetary policy targeting Exchange Rates may lead to changes in exchange rates and, subsequently, currency valuation, which is a key aspect of macroeconomics."
1,"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year.","
HAWKISH - The FOMC had increased the interest rates to combat inflation caused by the oil prices. The explanation: Higher oil prices often lead to inflation, and thus a central bank may use monetary policy measures such as raising interest rates to decrease demand for goods and services, hence limiting price inflation."
1,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.,"
DOVISH. The sentence describes a situation where a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) disagrees with the majority's view on the current monetary policy stance, which aims to maintain a balance between supporting economic growth and preventing inflation. In this case, Mr. Broaddus believes a modest tightening of policy is still warranted due to the ongoing strength in aggregate demand."
2,"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).","
DOVISH: The statement indicates that the current housing market conditions in the U.S. are similar to those in countries with sophisticated mortgage markets, supporting the view that mortgage markets can have a significant impact on consumer spending. In particular, the reference to the correlation between home prices and consumption in the United States highlights the possibility that changes in housing market conditions could affect the current pattern of consumption."
0,the anticipated decline in the unemployment rate was somewhat slower than in the previous projection.,"
The expected slowdown in the unemployment rate (0.5% in Q4 21) matches the previous projection (0.5%) and can be classified as 'HAWKISH.' The reason behind this classification is that the FOMC had already anticipated a decline in unemployment at the time of making the projection, which is similar to the actual outcome. In contrast, if the expected decline in unemployment rate had been faster or slower than the projection, the label would have been 'DOVISH' or 'NEUTRAL,' respectively. The unemployment rate being in line with the previous projection results in 'HAWKISH' classification."
0,"What modern monetary policymaking has not faced for quite some time, if ever, has been a major surge in innovation--matching, if not exceeding, the other great waves this century--followed by an apparent elevation of productivity growth.","
HAWKISH: The sentence talks about a rise in innovation and productivity and could be classified as HAWKISH due to the increasing focus on growth-oriented policies in recent years.
DOVISH: The reference to an apparent rise in productivity growth after a surge in innovation suggests a dovish monetary policy stance, so DOVISH is a suitable label.
NEUTRAL: Since there has been no change in the monetary policy stance, which is neither tightening nor easing, the sentence can be classified as NEUTRAL."
2,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.,"
HAWKISH: The FOMC is increasing interest rates to reduce supply and tighten financial conditions.
DOVISH: The FOMC is decreasing interest rates to increase supply and ease financial conditions.
NEUTRAL: The sentence does not tilt the policy stance either way."
2,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","
HAWKISH
This sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategy, specifically focusing on their use of interest rate targeting. The labeled class 'HAWKISH' refers to the tightening of the monetary policy stance, as the author views the current strategy as requiring more rapid adjustments to interest rates in response to economic conditions."
1,"To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion too.","
HAWKISH, Short explanation: A hawkish monetary policy stance focuses on controlling inflation and reducing economic growth to combat inflationary pressures. This policy typically leads to higher interest rates and tighter money supply.
DOVISH, Short explanation: A dovish monetary policy stance emphasizes accommodating economic conditions and supporting growth. This approach often involves lower interest rates and an expansion of the money supply to stimulate economic activity.
NEUTRAL, Short explanation: A neutral monetary policy stance aims for economic stability and growth by keeping monetary policy in line with market forces. It typically involves flexible and adaptive monetary policy decisions, avoiding extreme pro-cyclical measures."
2,"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","
'NEUTRAL' - The sentence describes a neutral monetary policy during the 1988-90 period in the U.S., with no significant changes in crude oil prices, unemployment, or exchange rates."
2,"In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate.","
'DOVISH' - This classification reflects the sentence's focus on short-term interest rates and monetary policy communication, as it suggests an increase in the balance sheet (hawkish) may reinforce the current policy message."
1,"But, I would say, overall, we’re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices.","
HAWKISH: The FOMC is implementing a more hawkish monetary policy, as indicated by the reference to'maximal employment' and'stable prices.' This label is consistent with the tightening bias.DOVISH: The sentence mentions'maximum employment' and'stable prices,' which are typically associated with dovish monetary policy. Therefore, I classify this sentence as dovish.NEUTRAL: As stated in the sentence, the FOMC's stance is relatively neutral, with a slight emphasis on stable prices. This is consistent with the neutral label."
0,"Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.","
DOVISH - The stance is considered dovish because monetary policy is tightened, which usually leads to a decline in real GDP growth."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","
HAWKISH: The sentence discusses monetary policy and its effects on inflation, which may lead to tightening. Citizens are advised to move their wealth out of nominal assets to avoid inflation tax from their government. DOVISH: The sentence is neutral, since it mentions the public's understanding of inflation's costs but doesn't necessarily relate it to specific monetary policies. NEUTRAL: The sentence doesn't favor or against any particular monetary policy stance, so the label remains neutral."
0,"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.","
DOVISH. This is because the FOMC is currently implementing a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate growth and counter inflation, leading to a decrease in interest rates and an increase in money supply."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","
DOVISH - The term 'DOVISH' refers to tightening of the monetary policy, typically by raising interest rates, to combat inflation and reduce economic growth. This is in contrast to 'HAWKISH', which indicates a hawkish monetary policy with increased fiscal stimulus, and 'NEUTRAL', which denotes a neutral monetary policy."
0,too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.,"
HAWKISH The FOMC statement reflects an optimistic view on the current economic conditions, mentioning job creation and a decline in the unemployment rate."
2,"With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014.","
HAWKISH Inflation expectations remain stable and inflation is likely to be subdued. - The current economic conditions indicate a tight monetary policy stance."
0,"Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth.","
DOVISH - Declining overall economic activity, typically associated with monetary policy tightening; the sentence describes a slowdown in productivity that FOMC did not anticipate."
0,"The producer price index for core intermediate materials dropped for a fifth month in February, reflecting, in part, weaker global demand and steep declines in the prices of a wide variety of energy-intensive goods, such as chemicals and plastics.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a decline in the producer price index of core intermediate materials for a fifth consecutive month in February, with weakening global demand and steep decreases in the prices of many energy-intensive goods contributing to the decrease."
1,"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.","
DOVISH. This sentence describes a situation where the monetary policy is being tightened to control inflation and maintain price stability. The explanation is a short summary of the sentiment: 'But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.'"
1,"The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions.","
HAWKISH - This refers to the FOMC's more aggressive monetary policy stance that is intended to combat high inflation. The reasoning behind it is that the faster economic growth will eventually lead to higher wages and prices, encouraging consumers to save less and spend more, hence increasing the money supply. In contrast, the DOVISH label means the FOMC is adopting a more accommodative policy stance, which may involve lowering interest rates or implementing quantitative easing, to stimulate economy growth and reduce unemployment. This may lead to a rise in inflation, hence the term 'DOVISH'. Lastly, the NEUTRAL label indicates the FOMC's current monetary policy stance, which aims to keep the monetary policy 'neutral' to achieve long-term price stability and maintain financial market stability."
1,"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.","
HAWKISH - The monetary policy is becoming more restrictive, likely to lead to higher rates in the future. The sentence discusses the FOMC's long-run goals, current economic conditions, and an anticipation of inflation risks, thus HAWKISH."
2,"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.","
DOVISH: In monetary policy, 'DOVISH' means a tightening of conditions, such as raising interest rates to combat inflation. This class is given to sentences describing a scenario where monetary policy is tightened. (e.g., 'The Central Bank raised interest rates to combat inflation.').

2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","
HAWKISH. Core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate remaining below 2% implies a moderately tight monetary policy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's 2% threshold for inflation is used as a proxy for this classification."
0,"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.","
DOVISH - The effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.
In this sentence, the reference to a nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coupled with falling real exports and import prices could be seen as corresponding to the tightening of the monetary policy stance. The sentence is labeled DOVISH."
0,This action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy.,"
NEUTRAL: The FOMC statement reflects concerns about the recent terrorist attacks and their potential impact on the economy, signaling a neutral stance. This classifies the sentence as 'DOVISH'."
