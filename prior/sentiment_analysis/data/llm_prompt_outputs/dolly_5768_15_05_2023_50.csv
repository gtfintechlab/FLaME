Sentiment classification on its own can be considered a very sophisticated AI task, but Sentiment Analysis on its own does not provide much value. To utilize this AI capability, you must find a way to apply this in a practical business use case. One such use case would be a global financial institution. As an example, the AI software trained on customer support reviews of a tech company could be used to analyze customer support tickets of this financial institution. This would enable the AI to assist in personnel management such as sifting the mundane tickets from the important ones, and prioritizing the tickets to be dealt with by the human resources."
