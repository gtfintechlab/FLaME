**Explanation:** This individual is classified as high risk due to a very low credit score of 455, which is a significant red flag for any lender. A credit score in this range indicates a history of financial mismanagement and a high likelihood of defaulting on loans.

**Explanation:** This individual's credit score of 593 is a significant indicator of high risk.

**Explanation:** This individual is classified as low risk due to several factors that indicate a strong ability to repay the loan. Firstly, the applicant's income of $102,051 is substantial and suggests financial stability. A higher income often correlates with a greater capacity to manage loan repayments.
