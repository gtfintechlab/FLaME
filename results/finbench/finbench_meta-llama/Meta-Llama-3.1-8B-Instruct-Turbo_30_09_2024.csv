                 This person is classified as LOW RISK because despite having a low credit score, he has a high annual income and is a citizen, which are positive indicators. The fact that he has two signers on the loan also suggests that he is likely to have a stable financial situation. However, the loan length is not specified, which could be a concern, but overall, the positive indicators outweigh the negative ones.
