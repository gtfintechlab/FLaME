A credit score of 455 is considered very poor and is the primary driver of this high-risk assessment.  Despite a good income and the presence of two signers, such a low credit score indicates a history of poor credit management and a significantly elevated likelihood of defaulting on the loan.  The 0-year loan length is unusual and may indicate an error in the data, but it doesn't change the overall risk profile given the very poor credit score.

This individual has several indicators suggesting a higher risk of loan default.

A longer loan term, while lowering monthly payments, increases the overall interest paid and the chance of unforeseen circumstances impacting the borrower's ability to repay.  The combination of a lower credit score and unknown loan term makes this a higher-risk profile.

While the individual has a reasonable income and a relatively short loan term, her credit score of 621 is below prime and suggests a history of difficulty managing credit.
