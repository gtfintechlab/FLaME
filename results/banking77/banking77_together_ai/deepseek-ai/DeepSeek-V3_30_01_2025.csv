Explain what the pending payment means?,"The sentence **""Explain what the pending payment means?""** belongs to the category **'pending_card_payment'**.

### Explanation:
- **Pending Payment**: A pending payment refers to a transaction that has been initiated but has not yet been fully processed or completed. In the context of card payments, this typically means that the payment has been authorized by the card issuer but the funds have not yet been transferred to the merchant. The payment remains in a ""pending"" state until the transaction is finalized, which can take a few days depending on the bank or payment processor.
