OUTOFCLAIM would be factual statements about past or present events without any assertion of future intent or possibility.\n\nLooking at the sentence: ""has been working to cross the $50 billion assets threshold"" – this indicates an ongoing effort.

So, the entity is actively trying to achieve this threshold. \n\nIs stating that they\'re working towards a goal considered a claim? A claim might be more like a statement that they will achieve it, or that they are certain to cross the threshold. However, here it\'s stating the effort they\'re putting in, which is a factual statement about their current activities. But wait, the classification criteria says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present info. So if the sentence is about their current efforts (factual present info), then it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if the sentence is making a claim about their intention or future outcome, then it\'s INCLAIM.\n\nWait, the sentence says ""has been working to cross"" – that\'s present perfect continuous, indicating an action that started in the past and is continuing now. The action is their effort towards the goal. The goal itself (crossing the threshold) hasn\'t been achieved yet. So the sentence is stating their ongoing effort towards a future goal. Is that a claim? Or is it a factual statement about their current activities?\n\nThe distinction here is tricky. If the sentence was ""we will cross the $50 billion threshold,"" that\'s a clear claim. But here, it\'s about the effort they\'re making. The fact that they\'re working towards it is a present fact. However, the implication is that they are trying to achieve something in the future. But according to the instructions, if it\'s just factual past or present information, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. If it includes a claim (which is not just factual), then INCLAIM.\n\nSo, the key is whether the sentence is making a claim (like an assertion that they will achieve it) or just stating their current actions. Since the sentence is about their current work towards the goal, not asserting that they will definitely achieve it, it\'s factual present information. Therefore, it should be OUTOFCLAIM. But wait, maybe the act of working towards a goal is considered a claim because it\'s part of their strategic intent. Hmm. The line between factual present action and a claim might be blurry here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of an internal project to achieve the threshold is part of their strategic claims. For example, if a company says they\'re working on a project to reach a certain milestone, that could be seen as a claim about their strategy or intentions. But according to the problem statement, if it\'s just factual past or present info, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. If it\'s a claim (not just factual), then INCLAIM. \n\nSo, the sentence is stating that they have been working (present perfect continuous) on an internal project to cross the threshold. That\'s a factual statement about their current and past actions. Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But I need to be careful. The instruction says INCLAIM if it consists of a claim and not just factual info. So if the sentence is about their efforts (factual), then OUTOFCLAIM.

A claim would be something that\'s a statement requiring support or proof, possibly about future intentions or assertions. Factual past or present info would be statements about what has already happened or is happening now.\n\nLooking at the sentence, the company is investing a specific amount with a goal to increase speeds by 2016. The investment is a current action (present tense), and the target (by 2016) is a future goal. But does stating an investment and a future goal count as a claim? \n\nWait, the instruction says to label INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present. So if the sentence is about future plans, that might be a claim. However, the example given in the instructions might help. If the sentence is reporting a current investment (factual) and a future outcome, does the future part make it a claim? Or is the investment itself the factual part, and the outcome (raising speeds) the claim?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is whether the sentence is making a forward-looking assertion that isn\'t just stating facts. Since the company is currently investing (factual), but the goal to raise speeds by 2016 is a future outcome they\'re committing to. That commitment could be considered a claim. However, the line between factual and claim might be thin here. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence is stating a fact about their current investment and their stated goal, which is a future plan, but presented as a fact (they are investing to do X), then maybe it\'s still factual. Because the investment is happening now, and the purpose is to achieve a future outcome. But the sentence itself is stating the company\'s current action and intention, which might be factual. \n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says OUTOFCLAIM if it\'s just factual past or present. So if the sentence includes future intentions, does that make it a claim? For example, if a company says ""we will do X,"" that\'s a claim. But if the sentence is reporting that the company is investing now in order to achieve a future goal, is that a claim or a factual statement about their current plans?\n\nI think in this case, the sentence is stating a current investment (factual) and the intended use of that investment (to raise speeds by 2016). The intended use is part of their plan, so it\'s a forward-looking statement. Therefore, it\'s a claim because it\'s asserting that this investment will lead to a specific outcome. However, if the sentence is merely reporting the investment and the stated goal without asserting that it will definitely happen, maybe it\'s still factual. But the line is blurry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is whether the sentence is making a claim that needs to be substantiated. If the company is investing with the goal of achieving something, that\'s their claim. But the sentence is reporting that they are making the investment for that purpose. So the sentence itself is a factual statement about the company\'s current actions and intentions. Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM because it\'s reporting what they are doing now and their stated objective, not making a claim that requires evidence.\n\nWait, but the instruction says ""INCLAIM if consist of a claim and not just factual past or present information"". So if the sentence includes future intentions, that\'s a claim. But if it\'s just stating current actions (investing) and their purpose (to achieve X by 2016), maybe that\'s a mix. The investment is present, the purpose is future. But the sentence is stating the company\'s current plan, which is a fact about their intentions. So perhaps it\'s still factual. For example, if a company says ""We plan to do X,"" that\'s a statement of their current plan, which is a fact. Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if they say ""We will do X,"" that\'s a claim about the future. \n\nIn the given sentence, the structure is ""is investing... to raise... by 2016."" The verb ""is investing"" is present continuous, indicating current action. The purpose clause ""to raise..."" indicates the goal. So the sentence is stating a current investment with a future goal. Since the investment is happening now, that\'s factual. The goal is part of their plan, which is a present fact about their intentions. Therefore, the entire sentence is reporting current actions and plans, making it OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut I need to be careful. The user\'s instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim, not just factual. So if the sentence is making a claim (like a promise or assertion about future outcomes), then INCLAIM. If it\'s just stating what they are doing now (investing) and their stated objective, which is a fact about their current plans, then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, the sentence is reporting the investment and the intended outcome. It\'s a statement of their current action and their goal. Since the goal is part of their plan, it\'s a present fact about their intentions. Therefore, it\'s factual and should be OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut wait, maybe the act of stating their intention to achieve something by 2016 is a claim. For example, if a company says ""We will achieve X by Y date,"" that\'s a claim. But if the sentence is structured as ""investing... to raise speeds by 2016,"" it\'s presenting the investment\'s purpose. The difference is subtle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is whether the sentence is making a verifiable statement about the future. If the company is committing to a future outcome, that\'s a claim. If they\'re just stating their current actions and plans, it\'s factual. \n\nIn this case, the sentence says they are investing now to achieve a future outcome. The investment is a present fact, but the outcome is a future expectation. Therefore, the part about raising speeds by 2016 is a claim because it\'s a future result that hasn\'t happened yet. So the sentence as a whole includes a claim about the future, hence INCLAIM. \n\nBut the user\'s instruction says to label OUTOFCLAIM if it\'s just factual past or present. So if the sentence includes future information, does that make it a claim? The example might help. Suppose the sentence was ""The company invested $1B in 2015."" That\'s past, so OUTOFCLAIM. If it\'s ""The company will invest $1B next year,"" that\'s a future claim, so INCLAIM. \n\nIn the given sentence, the investment is happening now (present), and the goal is future. The structure is ""is investing... to raise... by 2016."" The investment is present, the purpose is future. The sentence is stating the current action and the intended outcome. The intended outcome is part of their plan, which is a present fact. Therefore, the entire sentence is factual: they are investing now (fact) with the goal of achieving X (which is a present statement of intent, a fact about their plans). Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence was ""The company\'s investment will raise speeds by 2016,"" that\'s a claim about the future effect of the investment. But in the given sentence, it\'s ""investing... to raise..."" which is stating the purpose of the investment. The purpose is a present aspect of their action. So it\'s a factual statement about their current intentions. Hence, OUTOFCLAIM.\n'}, refusal=None, reasoning_content='\nOkay, let\'s tackle this query. The user wants me to act as an expert sentiment classifier, specifically for determining if a sentence is INCLAIM or OUTOFCLAIM. The key here is to check if the sentence contains a claim or just factual information about past or present.\n\nThe sentence given is: ""Notably, the company is investing c$1.14 billion (us $920 million) to raise browsing speeds to 1 gbit/s or higher by 2016.""\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a claim versus factual information. A claim would be something that\'s a statement requiring support or proof, possibly about future intentions or assertions. Factual past or present info would be statements about what has already happened or is happening now.\n\nLooking at the sentence, the company is investing a specific amount with a goal to increase speeds by 2016. The investment is a current action (present tense), and the target (by 2016) is a future goal. But does stating an investment and a future goal count as a claim? \n\nWait, the instruction says to label INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present. So if the sentence is about future plans, that might be a claim. However, the example given in the instructions might help. If the sentence is reporting a current investment (factual) and a future outcome, does the future part make it a claim? Or is the investment itself the factual part, and the outcome (raising speeds) the claim?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is whether the sentence is making a forward-looking assertion that isn\'t just stating facts. Since the company is currently investing (factual), but the goal to raise speeds by 2016 is a future outcome they\'re committing to. That commitment could be considered a claim. However, the line between factual and claim might be thin here. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence is stating a fact about their current investment and their stated goal, which is a future plan, but presented as a fact (they are investing to do X), then maybe it\'s still factual. Because the investment is happening now, and the purpose is to achieve a future outcome. But the sentence itself is stating the company\'s current action and intention, which might be factual. \n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says OUTOFCLAIM if it\'s just factual past or present. So if the sentence includes future intentions, does that make it a claim? For example, if a company says ""we will do X,"" that\'s a claim. But if the sentence is reporting that the company is investing now in order to achieve a future goal, is that a claim or a factual statement about their current plans?\n\nI think in this case, the sentence is stating a current investment (factual) and the intended use of that investment (to raise speeds by 2016). The intended use is part of their plan, so it\'s a forward-looking statement. Therefore, it\'s a claim because it\'s asserting that this investment will lead to a specific outcome. However, if the sentence is merely reporting the investment and the stated goal without asserting that it will definitely happen, maybe it\'s still factual. But the line is blurry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is whether the sentence is making a claim that needs to be substantiated. If the company is investing with the goal of achieving something, that\'s their claim. But the sentence is reporting that they are making the investment for that purpose. So the sentence itself is a factual statement about the company\'s current actions and intentions. Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM because it\'s reporting what they are doing now and their stated objective, not making a claim that requires evidence.\n\nWait, but the instruction says ""INCLAIM if consist of a claim and not just factual past or present information"".

this is above the expected capital deployment of $0.9-$1.3 billion for  2018.,"<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to act as an expert sentiment classifier, but actually, the task is to classify a sentence as either INCLAIM or OUTOFCLAIM. The key here is determining if the sentence contains a claim or just factual past/present info.

The sentence given is: ""this is above the expected capital deployment of $0.9-$1.3 billion for 2018."" 

First, I need to understand what constitutes a claim versus factual information. A claim would be an assertion that could be argued or needs support, while factual info is a statement about past or present facts. 

Looking at the sentence, it's stating that something is above the expected range for 2018. The phrase ""is above"" suggests a comparison or assertion that the current amount exceeds the expected. Since expectations are projections (which can be subjective or based on estimates), stating that something is above them might be a claim. However, if the expected capital deployment was a published or established figure, then referring to it as a fact might make it OUTOFCLAIM. 

But wait, the sentence doesn't provide context about who expected the capital deployment. If the expectation was a known fact (e.g., a company's official guidance), then the statement is comparing current data to a past expectation. In that case, the sentence is presenting factual information about a comparison. However, the act of stating that something is above could be seen as making a claim, especially if it's implying a deviation from what was planned. 

Alternatively, if the expected figures were part of a previous claim or projection, then pointing out that the current situation is above that might be factual. But the structure here is ""this is above the expected..."", which could be presenting a factual comparison based on numbers. 

Wait, the key is whether the sentence itself is making a claim or just stating a fact. If the expected capital deployment was a previously stated figure (like from a report), then saying ""this is above"" is a factual comparison. However, if the expectation is being presented as part of the current statement without prior reference, then it might be a claim. 

But the sentence doesn't provide evidence or context. It's just stating that the current amount is above the expected range. Since the expected range is given as a specific number for 2018, which is a past year, it's likely referring to a historical expectation. Therefore, the statement is comparing current (or another period's) deployment to a past expectation. That comparison could be a factual statement if the expectation was documented. However, the assertion that ""this is above"" might still be a claim because it's making a comparative statement that could be contested. 

Alternatively, if the expectation was a known target, then exceeding it is a factual outcome. For example, if a company had set a target of $0.9-$1.3B and the actual was higher, stating that fact would be OUTOFCLAIM. But the sentence says ""expected capital deployment"" which might refer to projections rather than targets. If the expectation was an estimate, then saying it's above could be a claim that the deployment exceeded estimates. 

Hmm. The line between fact and claim here is thin. If the expectation is a fact (e.g., ""the company expected to deploy X""), then stating that the current is above is a factual comparison. But if the expectation is not established and the sentence is asserting that the deployment is above some unspecified expectation, that's a claim. 

Given that the sentence includes specific numbers and a year (2018), it's likely referencing a known expectation. Therefore, the statement is a factual comparison, making it OUTOFCLAIM. But wait, the instruction says INCLAIM if it's a claim and not just factual past/present info. So if the sentence is making a claim by asserting that something is above expectations, even if the expectations are past, then it's INCLAIM. 

Wait, the key is whether the sentence is presenting a claim (something that can be argued) or just stating facts. If the expectation was a past fact (e.g., ""the expected deployment was X""), then saying ""this is above"" is a factual statement based on numbers. But if the expectation is part of the current assertion without prior basis, then it's a claim. 

Since the sentence includes the expected range as a specific past figure (for 2018), it's likely referring to a previously stated expectation. Therefore, the statement is a factual comparison between two numbers: the current deployment and the past expected range. Hence, it's OUTOFCLAIM. 

But I'm a bit confused. Let me check the definitions again. INCLAIM is for sentences that consist of a claim, not just factual past/present info. OUTOFCLAIM is for factual info. A claim would be an assertion that something is the case, possibly requiring evidence. If the sentence is stating that the current deployment is above a past expectation, that's a factual statement if the expectation was indeed set. However, if the expectation is not established and the sentence is making a comparison, that's a claim. 

Given that the sentence provides specific numbers and a year, it's likely referencing a known expectation. Therefore, the statement is factual, hence OUTOFCLAIM. But maybe the act of comparing and stating ""above"" is a claim. For example, if someone says ""our sales are above expectations,"" that's a claim because it's asserting a positive outcome. But if the expectations were publicly known, then it's a factual statement. 

I think the distinction here is whether the expectation is a matter of public record. If the expected range was part of a previous statement, then the current sentence is a factual comparison. If the expectation is being introduced here without prior context, then it's a claim. 

Since the sentence doesn't provide context about the source of the expectation, but the year is 2018, which is in the past, it's possible that the expectation was a known figure. Therefore, the sentence is stating a fact about exceeding that figure, making it OUTOFCLAIM. 

But another angle: a claim can be a statement that something is the case. Even if it's a fact, the way it's presented could be a claim. For example, ""This product is the best"" is a claim. However, ""Sales were $1M in 2018"" is a fact. 

In this case, ""this is above the expected..."" is a comparative statement. If the expectation is a fact (e.g., as per a report), then the comparison is factual. If the expectation is an assumption, then it's a claim. 

Given the ambiguity, but following the instruction that INCLAIM is for claims and not just factual info, and assuming that the expected capital deployment is a factual past expectation, the sentence is stating a fact, so OUTOFCLAIM. 

Wait, but the user might consider that stating something is above expectations is a claim, regardless of the expectation's source. Because it's making an assertion that requires support. For example, if a company says ""we exceeded our targets,"" that's a claim until proven. But if the targets are known and the numbers are public, then it's a fact. 

But without knowing the context, the safest approach is to consider that the sentence is making a comparative assertion, which is a claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. 

Hmm. This is tricky. Let me think again. The key is whether the sentence is presenting a claim (something that can be debated) or just stating facts. 

The sentence: ""this is above the expected capital deployment of $0.9-$1.3 billion for 2018."" 

If ""expected"" refers to a projection that was made in the past (e.g., in 2017 for 2018), then stating that the actual is above is a factual statement. But if ""expected"" is being used here to imply that the current deployment is higher than what was anticipated, and that anticipation isn't a documented fact, then it's a claim. 

Since the sentence includes specific numbers and a year, it's likely that the expected range is a documented figure. Therefore, the statement is a factual comparison, making it OUTOFCLAIM. 

But maybe the user wants INCLAIM for any comparative statement that isn't purely factual. For example, if the expectation is not a hard fact but an estimate, then exceeding it is a claim. 

Alternatively, the presence of ""expected"" might imply that the capital deployment was projected, and the current statement is asserting that it's above, which could be a claim. 

I think the answer is INCLAIM because the sentence is making a comparative assertion that the current deployment exceeds the expected range, which is a claim rather than a straightforward fact. Even if the expected range is a past figure, the act of stating that the current is above is a claim that could be supported or challenged. 

Wait, but if the expected range is a past fact (e.g., the company's guidance), then the statement is a factual comparison. For example, ""The capital deployment was $1.5B, above the expected $0.9-$1.3B."" That's a fact. But if the sentence is part of a statement without providing the actual numbers, just asserting it's above, then it's a claim. 

The given sentence is: ""this is above the expected capital deployment of $0.9-$1.3 billion for 2018."" 

Assuming ""this"" refers to the actual deployment, and the expected is the projected range, then stating that the actual is above is a factual statement if the actual number is known. But the sentence doesn't provide the actual number, just the assertion. Therefore, it's making a claim that the deployment is above the expected range, which would require evidence. Hence, INCLAIM.

But ""unprecedented"" could be considered a claim because it\'s making a comparative statement that might need evidence beyond the given data. However, the data provided (49.3% decline) might be the evidence for the ""unprecedented"" part. So perhaps the entire sentence is factual, presenting both the data and the conclusion based on it. In that case, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if the ""unprecedented"" part is a claim not supported by the data, then INCLAIM. But the data here is a specific figure, which might be used to support the claim of being unprecedented. So maybe the sentence is stating a fact with supporting data, hence OUTOFCLAIM. Alternatively, the use of ""unprecedented"" makes it a claim. I\'m a bit torn here. The key is whether the sentence is making a claim (something that could be debated or requires evidence) or just stating facts. The 49.3% contraction is a fact. The ""unprecedented"" part is a characterization. If that characterization is presented as a fact based on the data, then maybe it\'s still factual. But if ""unprecedented"" is an assertion beyond the data, then it\'s a claim. Since the sentence links the two parts with ""with,"" it\'s presenting the decline in demand as the reason for the capacity contraction. The ""unprecedented"" is describing the decline in demand. If that\'s a verifiable fact (e.g., if there\'s data showing that the decline was indeed the highest ever), then it\'s factual. But without that data in the sentence, ""unprecedented"" might be a claim. However, the sentence is from a context where such a statement might be based on data not mentioned here. But according to the instructions, we have to judge based on the sentence alone. So the sentence states that demand declined at an unprecedented level, which is a claim unless supported by evidence. The 49.3% contraction is a fact. The first part is a claim, the second is a fact. But the entire sentence combines both. The instruction says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim and not just factual information. So if any part is a claim, then INCLAIM. But maybe the sentence as a whole is presenting factual information, with the ""unprecedented"" being a conclusion from the data. In that case, it\'s still factual. Alternatively, the ""unprecedented"" is a subjective term, making it a claim. I think the key is that ""unprecedented"" is a subjective assessment, so that part is a claim. Therefore, the sentence includes a claim, so INCLAIM. Wait, but the instruction says ""not just factual past or present information.""

The key is to determine if the sentence contains a claim or just factual information.\n\nThe given sentence is: ""with air travel demand declining at an unprecedented level, capacity contracted 49.3% year over year in the first nine months of 2020.""\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between a claim and factual information. A claim would be something that\'s arguable or needs evidence, while factual information is a statement about past or present facts.\n\nLooking at the sentence, the first part mentions ""air travel demand declining at an unprecedented level."" The word ""unprecedented"" might suggest a claim because it\'s a strong adjective that could be subjective. However, the second part states a specific percentage decrease and a time frame, which seems factual.\n\nBut wait, ""unprecedented"" could be considered a factual descriptor if it\'s based on data. However, without specific data supporting that the decline is indeed unprecedented, it might be a claim. However, the second part with the 49.3% contraction is a verifiable fact. The sentence as a whole presents both a potential claim and a fact. But the instruction says to label OUTOFCLAIM if it\'s just factual past or present information. The first part might be a claim, but the second part is factual. However, the entire sentence is presenting factual data (the percentage decrease) and a statement about the decline being unprecedented. If ""unprecedented"" is used in a factual sense here, based on the data, then maybe the whole sentence is factual. But ""unprecedented"" could be an assertion that\'s not just a fact. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first part is a claim because ""unprecedented"" is a judgment, and the second part supports it with data. But the task says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim and not just factual information. If the sentence is presenting factual information (the 49.3% contraction) along with a description (""unprecedented""), which is based on that data, then maybe it\'s still factual.

But if they\'re highlighting their innovation as a reason for success, that might be a claim meant to showcase their effectiveness. \n\nHmm, the key here is whether the statement is presenting a fact or making an assertion that could be part of an argument. Since it\'s stating a specific revenue figure from a particular year and attributing it to innovation, it\'s likely reporting a past fact. The use of ""achieved"" is past tense, indicating something that happened.

The company is making an estimate about the effect of an act on their tax rate. The instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim, not just factual past/present info. OUTOFCLAIM if it\'s factual.\n\nA claim usually involves a prediction, opinion, or assertion that isn\'t just stating a fact. Here, the company is estimating a future outcome (reduction from 25% to 24%). That sounds like a projection, which is a claim. However, the user\'s note says to check if it\'s factual past or present. The sentence mentions 2017 (past) and ""current year"" (present). Wait, but the act\'s effect is a future projection based on current data. The estimate itself is a present action, but the reduction is a predicted outcome. So is the estimate a factual statement (they are currently estimating) or a claim about the future effect?\n\nThe company\'s estimation is a present action, but the content of the estimate is about a future reduction. The distinction here is whether the sentence is stating a fact (they made an estimate) vs. the estimate being a claim. The instruction says if it\'s a claim, label INCLAIM. If it\'s just factual past/present info, OUTOFCLAIM.\n\nSo, the sentence states that the company made an estimate (factual present info about their action), but the estimate itself is a claim about the tax rate reduction. Wait, but the user\'s instruction says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim, not just factual info.

The company is making an estimate about the effect of an act on their tax rate. The instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim, not just factual past/present info. OUTOFCLAIM if it\'s factual.\n\nA claim usually involves a prediction, opinion, or assertion that isn\'t just stating a fact.

Wait, but the act\'s effect is a future projection based on current data. The estimate itself is a present action, but the reduction is a predicted outcome. So is the estimate a factual statement (they are currently estimating) or a claim about the future effect?\n\nThe company\'s estimation is a present action, but the content of the estimate is about a future reduction. The distinction here is whether the sentence is stating a fact (they made an estimate) vs. the estimate being a claim. The instruction says if it\'s a claim, label INCLAIM.

Is that a claim? A claim would be something that can be disputed or needs evidence. Here, the company\'s stated reason for the action is presented as a fact. They\'re explaining their own move, not making a claim that needs support. So it\'s factual information about their intentions.

The subject is ""management,"" and the verb is ""anticipates."" Anticipates suggests a forward-looking statement, a prediction about the future. The contribution amount is $5-6 million from Shyft in 2018. \n\nNow, the definition for INCLAIM is if it\'s a claim, not just factual past/present info. OUTOFCLAIM is for factual info. Since ""anticipates"" is about future expectations, that\'s a projection or expectation, which is a claim made by management. It\'s not stating something that has already happened or is happening, but rather what they expect to happen. Therefore, this should be INCLAIM. \n\nWait, but 2018 might be a past year. If the sentence was written in 2017 or earlier, 2018 would be future. But if it\'s written now, 2018 is past. However, the problem doesn\'t specify the current time context. The original instruction says to classify based on whether it\'s a claim or factual past/present. If the sentence is from a time when 2018 was future, then ""anticipates"" is a claim. If 2018 is past, then maybe it\'s a past fact. But the sentence uses ""anticipates,"" which is present tense, so management\'s anticipation is in the present (regardless of the actual year). Wait, but the contribution is in 2018. If the current time is 2023, then 2018 is past. But the sentence\'s tense is present (""anticipates"") but referring to a past year. That might be conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe the key is that the verb ""anticipates"" is present tense, but the contribution is in 2018. If 2018 is in the past, then the anticipation is about a past contribution. But the sentence structure is management is currently anticipating (present tense) a contribution that was supposed to happen in 2018. That could be a bit confusing. However, regardless of the actual timeline, the sentence is expressing an expectation or prediction about a specific time (2018). If 2018 is in the past from the current perspective, then the statement might be a past anticipation. But the classification is based on whether it\'s a claim or factual info. \n\nA claim is a statement that asserts something that can be disputed or requires evidence. If the sentence is stating that management had an anticipation (past tense) about 2018, that would be a past fact (they anticipated it). But the original sentence uses present tense: ""anticipates,"" which would mean that as of the statement\'s time, management is currently anticipating a contribution in 2018. If 2018 is in the future relative to when the statement was made, then it\'s a forward-looking claim. If 2018 is in the past, then the statement is about current anticipation of a past contribution, which might be a factual statement about their current belief. \n\nBut the problem doesn\'t give context about when the sentence was written. The instruction says to label INCLAIM if it\'s a claim, not just factual past/present. The key is whether the sentence is making a forward-looking assertion (a claim) or stating a fact. Since ""anticipates"" is present tense, and the contribution is in 2018, which could be past or future depending on context. However, without specific context, perhaps we should assume that the sentence is from a time when 2018 is future. For example, if the statement was made in 2017, then 2018 is future. In that case, ""anticipates"" is a claim about the future. If the statement was made in 2019, then 2018 is past, and ""anticipates"" would be about a past contribution, which might be a factual statement of their current anticipation. \n\nBut the problem doesn\'t specify the time frame. The key is that the sentence uses ""anticipates,"" which is a present tense verb indicating a current expectation. The contribution is in 2018. If 2018 is in the past, then the sentence is stating that management currently anticipates (present tense) a contribution that was supposed to happen in the past. That seems odd. Maybe it\'s a typo, or perhaps the contribution is expected to be recognized in 2018, even if it\'s now past. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sentence is part of a document from 2017, where 2018 is future. In that case, it\'s a forward-looking claim. Since the problem doesn\'t provide context, perhaps the safest assumption is that the sentence is making a forward-looking statement (a claim) because ""anticipates"" is a present tense verb referring to a future event (2018). Therefore, it\'s INCLAIM. \n\nAlternatively, if 2018 is in the past, then the sentence is stating a current anticipation about a past contribution, which might be a factual statement about their current belief, which could be OUTOFCLAIM. But that\'s a bit of a stretch. \n\nThe instruction says to label INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present. A claim is an assertion that may not be proven, a prediction, or something that\'s not purely factual. Since ""anticipates"" is a statement of expectation, it\'s a subjective claim rather than a factual statement. Even if 2018 is past, the sentence is about their current anticipation, which is a present mental state, which is a fact. Wait, but the classification is about whether the sentence contains a claim. If the sentence is stating a fact about management\'s current anticipation, that\'s a factual statement (OUTOFCLAIM). But if the sentence is making a claim about future performance (anticipating a contribution), that\'s INCLAIM. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. Let\'s look at the definitions again. \n\nINCLAIM: consists of a claim and not just factual past or present information. \n\nOUTOFCLAIM: has just factual past or present information. \n\nSo, if the sentence is stating a fact about what management currently anticipates (present information), then it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if the sentence is making a claim (i.e., the anticipation itself is the claim), then it\'s INCLAIM. \n\nWait, but the anticipation is a present fact. For example, ""Management believes X"" is a present fact about their belief. But the belief itself might be a claim. However, the instruction says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim. So if the sentence is reporting that management is making a claim (their anticipation), then it\'s INCLAIM. But if the sentence is simply stating a fact about their anticipation (as a present fact), then it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let\'s think of examples. \n\nExample 1: ""The company reported a profit of $5 million in 2018."" That\'s a factual past statement, OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nExample 2: ""The company expects to make a profit of $5 million in 2018.""

Hmm, maybe I\'m conflating sentiment with claim. The user\'s instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim, not just factual info. \n\nWait, the key is whether it\'s a claim versus factual past/present.

So maybe OUTOFCLAIM is correct. \n\nAlternatively, the act of providing guidance could be seen as a claim because it\'s a forward-looking statement. Companies make claims about their future performance. So revising guidance is a claim about future expectations. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The user\'s instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present. So if the sentence is stating a current expectation (a present fact), then OUTOFCLAIM. If it\'s making a prediction or assertion about the future, then INCLAIM. \n\nThe sentence uses ""expects"" which is present tense, indicating their current expectation.

Let me check examples. \n\nFor instance, ""The company projects sales to increase next year"" would be a claim (INCLAIM). ""The company revised its guidance from X to Y"" is stating a present fact about their guidance change (OUTOFCLAIM). \n\nIn the given sentence, it\'s the latter case. They are stating the current guidance, which is a present fact. So the label should be OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut wait, the guidance itself is a forward-looking statement. So when the company issues guidance, that\'s a claim about the future. Therefore, the sentence is reporting a claim made by the company, hence INCLAIM. \n\nHmm. The user\'s instruction says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim. So if the sentence itself contains a claim (the company\'s expectation), then INCLAIM. If the sentence is just reporting factual info (e.g., past sales numbers), then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, the company is making a claim about their future net sales. The sentence is conveying that claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nBut the user\'s instruction might consider the company\'s own guidance as factual information. For example, if the company says ""we expect X,"" that\'s a factual statement about their current expectation. So the sentence is reporting a fact (their current expectation), which is a present fact. Hence, OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. I think the key is whether the sentence is presenting a claim (something that can be argued or needs support) versus a statement of fact. The company\'s guidance is a factual statement about their current expectations, even if those expectations are about the future. Therefore, it\'s a present fact, so OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence was ""the company will achieve higher sales,"" that\'s a claim. But here, it\'s their current expectation, which is a fact. \n\nI think the correct label here is OUTOFCLAIM because it\'s reporting the company\'s updated guidance, which is a present fact about their expectations, not a claim in itself. The claim would be the expectation, but the sentence is stating that the company has this expectation as a current fact. \n\nWait, but the user\'s instruction says ""consist of a claim and not just factual past or present information"".

The expectation itself is a claim about the future. So the sentence contains a claim (the expectation of future sales), hence INCLAIM. \n\nI think this is the right approach.

The user\'s instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present. So if the sentence is stating a current expectation (a present fact), then OUTOFCLAIM. If it\'s making a prediction or assertion about the future, then INCLAIM. \n\nThe sentence uses ""expects"" which is present tense, indicating their current expectation. So it\'s a present fact about their guidance. Therefore, OUTOFCLAIM. But I need to be careful. Let me check examples. \n\nFor instance, ""The company projects sales to increase next year"" would be a claim (INCLAIM). ""The company revised its guidance from X to Y"" is stating a present fact about their guidance change (OUTOFCLAIM). \n\nIn the given sentence, it\'s the latter case. They are stating the current guidance, which is a present fact. So the label should be OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut wait, the guidance itself is a forward-looking statement. So when the company issues guidance, that\'s a claim about the future. Therefore, the sentence is reporting a claim made by the company, hence INCLAIM. \n\nHmm. The user\'s instruction says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim. So if the sentence itself contains a claim (the company\'s expectation), then INCLAIM. If the sentence is just reporting factual info (e.g., past sales numbers), then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, the company is making a claim about their future net sales. The sentence is conveying that claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nBut the user\'s instruction might consider the company\'s own guidance as factual information. For example, if the company says ""we expect X,"" that\'s a factual statement about their current expectation. So the sentence is reporting a fact (their current expectation), which is a present fact. Hence, OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. I think the key is whether the sentence is presenting a claim (something that can be argued or needs support) versus a statement of fact. The company\'s guidance is a factual statement about their current expectations, even if those expectations are about the future. Therefore, it\'s a present fact, so OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nAlternatively, if the sentence was ""the company will achieve higher sales,"" that\'s a claim. But here, it\'s their current expectation, which is a fact. \n\nI think the correct label here is OUTOFCLAIM because it\'s reporting the company\'s updated guidance, which is a present fact about their expectations, not a claim in itself. The claim would be the expectation, but the sentence is stating that the company has this expectation as a current fact. \n\nWait, but the user\'s instruction says ""consist of a claim and not just factual past or present information"". So if the sentence includes a claim (the expectation about future sales), then it\'s INCLAIM. If it\'s just stating that they changed their guidance (a fact), then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThe sentence says ""the company now expects..."", which is a present fact about their expectation. The expectation itself is a claim about the future. So the sentence contains a claim (the expectation of future sales), hence INCLAIM. \n\nI think this is the right approach. The presence of the company\'s expectation (a forward-looking statement) makes it a claim. Therefore, INCLAIM.\n'))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=1389, prompt_tokens=147, total_tokens=1536, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), service_tier=None, prompt=[])"

The numbers (6%) and the time frame are specific, which makes it sound factual. The mention of reasons (backed by...) could be part of a factual explanation. However, sometimes companies might present such statements as claims to highlight their performance. But the key here is whether it\'s just reporting past data. Since it\'s stating a past event with specific numbers and reasons, it\'s likely factual. There\'s no indication of future projection or subjective language. It\'s reporting what happened, not making a persuasive argument. So I\'d lean towards OUTOFCLAIM. But wait, the instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual.

Here, it\'s stating they have the funds allocated for growth. Since it\'s reporting existing funds and their intended use without making a promise or assertion of success, it\'s more factual.

That\'s a claim because it\'s projecting future outcomes based on current factors.\n\nThe second part mentions the loss ratio estimated to be 60-66% due to improved underwriting. ""Is estimated"" could be a factual statement if it\'s referring to a current estimate, but ""on improved underwriting"" implies a reason for the estimate. However, estimates can still be factual if they\'re based on present data. But the first part\'s future projection is definitely a claim.\n\nSo the sentence has both elements. The first part is a claim, the second might be a present estimate. But since the instruction says to label INCLAIM if there\'s any claim, even if part is factual. So the presence of a future projection (will drive) makes the whole sentence INCLAIM.\n'))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=388, prompt_tokens=148, total_tokens=536, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), service_tier=None, prompt=[])"

The first part is ""launched 20 years back"" – that\'s a factual statement about when it started. Then ""over 260 million units sold so far"" – also a fact, a number. Then ""continues to be one of the leading contributors to revenues"" – this might be a claim. The word ""continues"" suggests an ongoing state, but is that a fact or a claim? If the company has data showing it\'s a leading contributor, then maybe it\'s factual. However, ""leading contributor"" could be subjective. Also, the 39% contribution is a specific number, which is factual. \n\nSo the part that\'s possibly a claim is ""continues to be one of the leading contributors."" If that\'s based on verifiable data (like the 39% figure), then maybe it\'s factual. But if ""leading"" is an assertion without clear criteria, it might be a claim. The 39% is a fact, but presenting it as a leading contributor could be a claim. However, since the 39% supports the idea of being a leading contributor, maybe it\'s still factual. \n\nWait, the instructions say INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual. So if the sentence is stating facts (like numbers and dates) and the conclusion (leading contributor) is supported by those facts, then it\'s factual. But maybe the conclusion itself is a claim. For example, if they say ""continues to be one of the leading,"" that\'s a statement that could be considered a claim because it\'s asserting a position. However, if the 39% is a fact that directly supports being a leading contributor, then maybe it\'s factual. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the numerical data makes it factual. The 260 million units sold and 39% contribution are specific numbers, so those are facts. The part about ""continues to be one of the leading contributors"" is a conclusion based on those facts, but is that a claim? If the data supports it, then it\'s a factual statement. But perhaps the term ""leading"" is subjective. For example, leading compared to what? Other products? The industry? Without context, ""leading"" might be a claim. \n\nSo the sentence includes both factual data and a statement that could be a claim. The question is whether the presence of the claim part makes it INCLAIM. The instruction says to label INCLAIM if it consists of a claim and not just factual information. So if there\'s any claim in there, it\'s INCLAIM. Otherwise, if all parts are factual, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThe key parts are the factual numbers and the assertion about being a leading contributor. The assertion might be the claim. So I need to decide if that assertion is a claim or a factual statement. If the company\'s own data shows that 39% contribution makes it a leading contributor, then maybe it\'s factual. But ""leading"" is a relative term. If they are the top contributor, that\'s a fact. If they are one of the leading, that\'s more vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sentence is presenting factual information: the launch date, units sold, revenue contribution. The part about ""continues to be one of the leading contributors"" is a conclusion based on those facts. But is that conclusion a claim? If the facts are presented and the conclusion is drawn from them, then it\'s a factual statement. However, if the conclusion is an assertion without evidence, it\'s a claim. Here, the evidence is provided (39%), so maybe it\'s factual. \n\nWait, the instruction says ""not just factual past or present information."" So if the sentence includes a claim in addition to factual info, it\'s INCLAIM. If it\'s only factual, then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, the sentence states facts (launched 20 years ago, 260 million units sold, 39% contribution) and then says ""continues to be one of the leading contributors."" The ""continues to be"" part is a present state, but is that a claim? If the 39% is a fact that supports being a leading contributor, then the statement is factual. However, ""leading"" might imply comparison with others, which isn\'t provided here. So maybe that part is a claim. \n\nFor example, if they said ""is the top contributor,"" that\'s a factual statement if they have the highest percentage.

Therefore, the sentence includes a claim (being a leading contributor) along with factual info, so it should be INCLAIM. \n\nBut wait, the 39% is a specific number. If the company defines ""leading contributors"" as those contributing a certain percentage, then it\'s factual.

The example given is ""ad impressions served rose 40%, driven by facebook mobile news feed.""\n\nFirst, I need to understand the difference between a claim and factual information. A claim would be something that\'s arguable or needs support, while factual info is a statement about past or present events without any assertion.\n\nLooking at the sentence: It states that ad impressions rose 40% because of Facebook\'s mobile news feed. The rise is a past event, and the cause is attributed to a specific factor. But is this a claim or just a fact? The 40% increase is a measurable figure, which seems factual. The part about being driven by Facebook mobile news feed could be a claim if it\'s presenting a reason that might need evidence. However, if it\'s just reporting a known cause, then it\'s factual. \n\nWait, the key here is whether the sentence is making a claim (like an assertion that could be debated) or just stating facts. If the sentence is reporting data and a reason that\'s accepted, then it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if the causation (driven by...) is presented as a claim, then INCLAIM. \n\nIn business contexts, stating that something was ""driven by"" a specific factor is often a claim because it implies causation which might require evidence. However, if it\'s a straightforward report from the company, maybe they\'re stating it as a fact. But according to the user\'s instruction, INCLAIM is for claims, not just factual past/present info. So if the sentence is presenting the cause as a fact, then OUTOFCLAIM. But if the causation is part of the claim, then INCLAIM. \n\nHmm. The sentence structure is ""X happened, driven by Y."" The first part is a factual statement (rose 40%), the second part gives a reason. The question is whether the reason is presented as a claim. Since it\'s a past event, and the reason is stated as a fact, maybe it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if the causation is part of the claim (i.e., the speaker is asserting that Facebook mobile caused the rise), then it\'s INCLAIM. \n\nThe user\'s instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present info. So if the entire sentence is factual, including the causation, then OUTOFCLAIM. But causation can be a claim. For example, if a company says ""sales increased because of our new product,"" that\'s a claim. But if it\'s a report stating that ""sales increased, driven by market expansion,"" and that\'s a known fact, then maybe OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, ""driven by facebook mobile news feed"" – unless it\'s a known fact that Facebook\'s news feed caused the increase, it\'s a claim. Since the sentence is likely from a company\'s report, they might be making a claim about the cause. Therefore, INCLAIM. But I need to check if the causation is presented as a fact or a claim. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sentence is reporting past data and the reason as facts, so OUTOFCLAIM. For example, if a financial report states ""revenue increased due to higher demand,"" that\'s presented as a fact, not a claim. So perhaps this sentence is similar. \n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says ""not just factual past or present information."" So if the sentence has a claim (which is more than just stating facts), then INCLAIM. If it\'s only stating facts, then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThe sentence has two parts: the rise in ad impressions (fact) and the cause (Facebook mobile). The cause is presented as a fact here. So maybe it\'s all factual. Therefore, OUTOFCLAIM. But I\'m not sure. Maybe the attribution to Facebook mobile is a claim. For example, if the company is attributing the rise to their own efforts, that\'s a claim. But if it\'s an external report stating that Facebook\'s news feed caused it, that\'s a fact. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether the causation is presented as a fact or a claim. Since the sentence doesn\'t use hedging language like ""we believe"" or ""it is suggested that,"" but rather states it directly, it might be presented as a fact. Therefore, OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. The sentence is stating two things: a 40% rise (fact) and the reason (Facebook mobile). If the reason is part of the factual information, then OUTOFCLAIM. If the reason is a claim made by the speaker, then INCLAIM. \n\nIn business contexts, when companies report results, they often state reasons as facts. So maybe this is considered factual. Therefore, the label should be OUTOFCLAIM. But I\'m not entirely certain. Alternatively, the presence of a causal statement (driven by) could be seen as a claim. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The user\'s instruction says: ""Label ‘INCLAIM’ if consist of a claim and not just factual past or present information, or ‘OUTOFCLAIM’ if it has just factual past or present information."" \n\nSo, if the sentence includes a claim (something that\'s an assertion beyond just stating facts), then INCLAIM. The part ""driven by facebook mobile news feed"" is explaining the cause. If that\'s an assertion that requires support, then it\'s a claim. If it\'s a known fact, then it\'s not. \n\nSince the sentence is likely from a report or statement where the company is explaining the reason for the increase, they are making a claim about the cause. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nBut wait, maybe the rise in ad impressions is a fact, and the reason is also presented as a fact. For example, if it\'s from a financial report that\'s stating the cause as a matter of record, then it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nI think the key is whether the causal statement is a claim. If the sentence is from a source that is asserting the cause without providing evidence, then it\'s a claim. If it\'s a neutral statement of fact, then it\'s not. \n\nIn this case, the sentence is presented as a statement of fact: ""ad impressions served rose 40%, driven by facebook mobile news feed."" The structure is stating two facts: the rise and the cause. Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut I\'m still conflicted. Maybe the presence of a causal factor makes it a claim. For example, if a company says ""our sales increased because of our new product,"" that\'s a claim. If a third-party report says ""sales increased due to new product,"" that\'s a fact. \n\nAssuming the sentence is from the company\'s own report, then ""driven by facebook mobile news feed"" is their claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nAlternatively, if it\'s a neutral third-party report stating the cause as a fact, then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut without context, we have to assume. The sentence doesn\'t specify the source. So perhaps the safest approach is to consider that stating a cause is a claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nBut I\'m not sure. Let me check similar examples. For instance, ""The stock price fell 2% due to market volatility."" If that\'s a factual report, then OUTOFCLAIM. If it\'s a company\'s explanation, then it\'s a claim. \n\nIn the absence of context, perhaps the default is to treat causal statements as claims. Therefore, the label would be INCLAIM. \n\nWait, but the user\'s instruction says ""not just factual past or present information."" So if the sentence includes more than just facts, like explanations or claims, then INCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, the sentence includes a reason (driven by...), which is an explanation. So that\'s a claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nYes, I think that\'s the right approach. The presence of a causal explanation makes it a claim, hence INCLAIM.\n'}, refusal=None, reasoning_content='\nOkay, let\'s tackle this query.

So if the sentence is presenting the cause as a fact, then OUTOFCLAIM. But if the causation is part of the claim, then INCLAIM. \n\nHmm. The sentence structure is ""X happened, driven by Y."" The first part is a factual statement (rose 40%), the second part gives a reason. The question is whether the reason is presented as a claim. Since it\'s a past event, and the reason is stated as a fact, maybe it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. But if the causation is part of the claim (i.e., the speaker is asserting that Facebook mobile caused the rise), then it\'s INCLAIM. \n\nThe user\'s instruction says INCLAIM if it\'s a claim and not just factual past/present info. So if the entire sentence is factual, including the causation, then OUTOFCLAIM. But causation can be a claim. For example, if a company says ""sales increased because of our new product,"" that\'s a claim. But if it\'s a report stating that ""sales increased, driven by market expansion,"" and that\'s a known fact, then maybe OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, ""driven by facebook mobile news feed"" – unless it\'s a known fact that Facebook\'s news feed caused the increase, it\'s a claim. Since the sentence is likely from a company\'s report, they might be making a claim about the cause. Therefore, INCLAIM. But I need to check if the causation is presented as a fact or a claim. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire sentence is reporting past data and the reason as facts, so OUTOFCLAIM. For example, if a financial report states ""revenue increased due to higher demand,"" that\'s presented as a fact, not a claim. So perhaps this sentence is similar. \n\nWait, the user\'s instruction says ""not just factual past or present information."" So if the sentence has a claim (which is more than just stating facts), then INCLAIM. If it\'s only stating facts, then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nThe sentence has two parts: the rise in ad impressions (fact) and the cause (Facebook mobile). The cause is presented as a fact here. So maybe it\'s all factual. Therefore, OUTOFCLAIM. But I\'m not sure. Maybe the attribution to Facebook mobile is a claim. For example, if the company is attributing the rise to their own efforts, that\'s a claim. But if it\'s an external report stating that Facebook\'s news feed caused it, that\'s a fact. \n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. The key is whether the causation is presented as a fact or a claim. Since the sentence doesn\'t use hedging language like ""we believe"" or ""it is suggested that,"" but rather states it directly, it might be presented as a fact. Therefore, OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut I need to make a decision. The sentence is stating two things: a 40% rise (fact) and the reason (Facebook mobile). If the reason is part of the factual information, then OUTOFCLAIM. If the reason is a claim made by the speaker, then INCLAIM. \n\nIn business contexts, when companies report results, they often state reasons as facts. So maybe this is considered factual. Therefore, the label should be OUTOFCLAIM. But I\'m not entirely certain. Alternatively, the presence of a causal statement (driven by) could be seen as a claim. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The user\'s instruction says: ""Label ‘INCLAIM’ if consist of a claim and not just factual past or present information, or ‘OUTOFCLAIM’ if it has just factual past or present information."" \n\nSo, if the sentence includes a claim (something that\'s an assertion beyond just stating facts), then INCLAIM. The part ""driven by facebook mobile news feed"" is explaining the cause. If that\'s an assertion that requires support, then it\'s a claim. If it\'s a known fact, then it\'s not. \n\nSince the sentence is likely from a report or statement where the company is explaining the reason for the increase, they are making a claim about the cause. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nBut wait, maybe the rise in ad impressions is a fact, and the reason is also presented as a fact. For example, if it\'s from a financial report that\'s stating the cause as a matter of record, then it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nI think the key is whether the causal statement is a claim. If the sentence is from a source that is asserting the cause without providing evidence, then it\'s a claim. If it\'s a neutral statement of fact, then it\'s not. \n\nIn this case, the sentence is presented as a statement of fact: ""ad impressions served rose 40%, driven by facebook mobile news feed."" The structure is stating two facts: the rise and the cause. Therefore, it\'s OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut I\'m still conflicted. Maybe the presence of a causal factor makes it a claim. For example, if a company says ""our sales increased because of our new product,"" that\'s a claim. If a third-party report says ""sales increased due to new product,"" that\'s a fact. \n\nAssuming the sentence is from the company\'s own report, then ""driven by facebook mobile news feed"" is their claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nAlternatively, if it\'s a neutral third-party report stating the cause as a fact, then OUTOFCLAIM. \n\nBut without context, we have to assume. The sentence doesn\'t specify the source. So perhaps the safest approach is to consider that stating a cause is a claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nBut I\'m not sure. Let me check similar examples. For instance, ""The stock price fell 2% due to market volatility."" If that\'s a factual report, then OUTOFCLAIM. If it\'s a company\'s explanation, then it\'s a claim. \n\nIn the absence of context, perhaps the default is to treat causal statements as claims. Therefore, the label would be INCLAIM. \n\nWait, but the user\'s instruction says ""not just factual past or present information."" So if the sentence includes more than just facts, like explanations or claims, then INCLAIM. \n\nIn this case, the sentence includes a reason (driven by...), which is an explanation. So that\'s a claim. Therefore, INCLAIM. \n\nYes, I think that\'s the right approach. The presence of a causal explanation makes it a claim, hence INCLAIM.\n'))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=1774, prompt_tokens=123, total_tokens=1897, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), service_tier=None, prompt=[])"
