**Explanation**:

In the first example, the numerals $3.5 million and $1.9 million are related to the expenses incurred by the Operating Partnership pursuant to the Corporate Services Agreement. Based on the context, these expenses are related to selling, general, and administrative expenses from transactions with related parties. Therefore, the corresponding XBRL tag is ""us-gaap:RelatedPartyTransactionSellingGeneralAndAdministrativeExpensesFromTransactionsWithRelatedParty"".

In the second example, the numeral $119 million is related to the exchange of non-convertible debentures in project financing. Based on the context, this is a debt instrument exchange. Therefore, the corresponding XBRL tag is ""us-gaap:DebtInstrumentExchangeNonconvertibleDebentures"".
