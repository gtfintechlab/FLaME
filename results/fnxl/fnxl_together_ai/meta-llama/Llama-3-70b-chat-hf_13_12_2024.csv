* $968 is the total environmental reserves balance, so it's associated with the general tag `us-gaap:EnvironmentalLiabilities`.
* $667 is related to U.S. downstream operations, which is a current liability, so it's associated with `us-gaap:EnvironmentalLiabilitiesCurrent`.

* $1 is related to other businesses, which is a current liability, so it's associated with `us-gaap:EnvironmentalLiabilitiesCurrent`.
