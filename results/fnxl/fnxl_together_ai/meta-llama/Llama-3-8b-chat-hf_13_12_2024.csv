Here's my reasoning:

* The sentence mentions ""IP rights"" and ""Indices segment"", which suggests that the numeral 132.0 is related to intangible assets or intellectual property.
* The XBRL tag ""us-gaap:PropertyPlantAndEquipmentNet"" is used to report the net value of property, plant, and equipment, which includes intangible assets such as patents, copyrights, and trademarks.
* Since the sentence specifically mentions ""IP rights"", I believe it is more likely that the numeral 132.0 is related to intangible assets rather than physical property, plant, and equipment.

Therefore, the expected output would be:
