The amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to our parent company in 2020 is approximately $1.0 billion in the aggregate.,[1.0],HUMANA INC.,10-K,"Based on the context of the sentence, the numeral $1.0 billion appears to represent the aggregate amount of ordinary dividends that may be paid to the parent company.
