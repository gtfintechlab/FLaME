Explanation: The sentence indicates that the economic expansion is ""still robust,"" which might suggest that the economy is strong and possibly inflationary pressures are building. In such scenarios, a hawkish stance would lean towards tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation. However, the sentence itself does not explicitly mention any policy actions or intentions to tighten policy; it merely describes the state of the economy. Therefore, classifying it as hawkish is somewhat inferential based on the context that a robust economy might warrant tighter policy.
