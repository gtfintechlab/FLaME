"Operating profits in the half were  0.8 m , down from  0.9 m as Glisten invested in the brand and the management team .","2 - Indirect causal

Explanation:
The sentence ""Operating profits in the half were 0.8 m, down from 0.9 m as Glisten invested in the brand and the management team"" implies that Glisten's investment in the brand and the management team led to a decrease in operating profits. This is an example of indirect causality because the investment itself did not directly cause the decrease in profits. Instead, the investment may have had a variety of indirect effects that ultimately led to the decrease in profits.
