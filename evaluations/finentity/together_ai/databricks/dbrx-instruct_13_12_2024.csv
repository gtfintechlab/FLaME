                The FAA said it will publish a draft environmental assessment for the public to review and comment on.
                The FAA's decision comes after SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in February that the company was hoping to launch the Starship to orbit as early as this year.
                The FAA said it will consider all comments received during the public review period before making a final decision on whether to allow the launch.
                The FAA's decision is a key step for SpaceX, which has been working to develop the Starship as a reusable spacecraft that could carry cargo and people to the moon, Mars and beyond.
                The Starship is designed to be a fully reusable spacecraft that could carry up to 100 people to Mars.
                The FAA's decision is also a key step for the space industry, which has been working to develop reusable spacecraft that could make space travel more affordable and accessible.

    A source familiar with the matter said on Friday that Mobileye may lower its IPO valuation estimate due to adverse market conditions.   ,"The source said that the company, which is a supplier of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to major automakers, may now be looking at a valuation of around $15 billion to $16 billion, down from the $20 billion it had previously targeted.
                    The source added that the final valuation could still change depending on market conditions and investor demand.
                    Mobileye, which is based in Israel, had initially planned to go public in the United States in the first half of this year, but the IPO has been delayed due to market volatility.
                    The company's ADAS technology uses cameras and sensors to help drivers avoid accidents, and it has been a key supplier to automakers such as General Motors, Ford, and BMW.
                    Mobileye's IPO is being closely watched as a test of investor appetite for technology companies, particularly those in the automotive sector.
                    The company's shares are expected to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ""MBLY.""
                    In a statement, Mobileye said that it ""continues to make progress towards its planned IPO"" but declined to comment on the valuation.
                    The company's IPO is being led by Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays.

"Walmart Inc <WMT.N> had also lifted its annual sales and profit outlook on strong demand for groceries and better inventory levels, but it forecast a muted holiday season as discretionary spending remains pressured. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was ordering a comprehensive review of the safety of the Boeing 737 MAX in the wake of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last month that killed all 189 people on board.
                The FAA said it was concerned about the plane's automated control system, which can push the nose of the plane down if it senses an imminent stall. The agency said it was working with Boeing and other civil aviation authorities to ensure the safety of the plane.
                The review will include a look at the design and certification of the plane's automated control system, as well as the training and maintenance procedures for the plane.
                The FAA's review comes as Boeing faces increasing scrutiny over the safety of the 737 MAX, which is the company's best-selling plane. The Lion Air crash was the first fatal accident involving the plane, which has been in service for about a year.
                Boeing has said it is cooperating with the FAA's review and is confident in the safety of the 737 MAX. The company has also said it is working on a software update for the plane's automated control system.

                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to require the immediate inspection of certain GE engines following an engine failure on a Boeing 787-8 operated by Japan Airlines (JAL) on December 4, 2022.
                The engine failure on the JAL 787-8 resulted in the aircraft returning to Tokyo's Narita International Airport. The FAA said the AD requires operators to inspect the fan midshaft of certain GE engines within 30 days.

                The FAA said it was working with GE and Boeing to develop a permanent solution to the engine issue. The agency said it was not aware of any other similar engine failures.
                The FAA said it was not aware of any injuries or fatalities related to the engine failures. The agency said it was working with international aviation authorities to address the issue.

                The FAA said Boeing's failure to ensure that the slat tracks were properly manufactured and heat treated ""is a violation of the Federal Aviation Regulations.""
                Boeing said it is aware of the FAA's proposed penalty and is ""currently reviewing the details.""
                The FAA said it has not received any reports of in-flight issues related to the slat tracks, but it is requiring Boeing to replace the non-conforming slat tracks with new, conforming slat tracks.
                The FAA said the proposed penalty is based on Boeing's failure to ensure that the slat tracks were properly manufactured and heat treated, as well as its failure to notify the FAA of the non-conformance.
                The FAA said it is proposing the penalty under its authority to assess civil penalties for violations of the Federal Aviation Regulations.
                The FAA said it is also proposing to require Boeing to develop and implement a plan to prevent similar non-conformances in the future.
                The FAA said it is seeking public comment on the proposed penalty and the proposed corrective action plan.
                The FAA said it will consider all comments received before making a final decision on the proposed penalty and the proposed corrective action plan.
                The FAA said it is committed to ensuring the safety of the flying public and will take all necessary actions to ensure that aircraft are safe to fly.
                The FAA said it is working closely with Boeing and other stakeholders to ensure that the 737 MAX is safe to return to service.
                The FAA said it is also working closely with international aviation authorities to ensure that the 737 MAX is safe to fly in other countries.
                The FAA said it is committed to maintaining the highest level of safety in the aviation industry and will continue to work with all stakeholders to ensure that aircraft are safe to fly.

"The company also dragged down shares of other insures including Admiral Group <ADML.L> and Direct Line Insurance, which tumbled 12% and 7%, respectively. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it would order a temporary grounding of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner fleet until a fire risk linked to the plane's batteries is resolved. The FAA's action came after an All Nippon Airways Co Ltd (ANA) 9202.T Dreamliner made an emergency landing in Japan due to a cockpit message indicating a battery problem. The incident was the latest in a series of problems with the 787's batteries, which have caused fires or smoldering incidents on several planes. The FAA's action is a significant setback for Boeing, which has delivered 50 of the 787s to airlines around the world. The company has orders for more than 800 of the planes, which list for $207 million each. The FAA's action is also a blow to the reputation of the 787, which Boeing has touted as a game-changer in commercial aviation because of its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. The 787's problems have also raised questions about the FAA's certification process for new aircraft. The FAA certified the 787 in 2011 after a rigorous testing program, but the battery problems have called into question the agency's oversight of the plane's development. The FAA's action is the latest in a series of setbacks for Boeing, which has been struggling to recover from the grounding of its 737 MAX planes after two deadly crashes. The 737 MAX, which is Boeing's best-selling plane, has been grounded since March 2019, and the company has been working to fix the plane's software and other issues. The grounding of the 737 MAX has cost Boeing billions of dollars and has damaged its reputation as a leader in commercial aviation. The FAA's action on the 787 is a reminder that Boeing's problems are not limited to the 737 MAX. The company is facing a number of challenges, including competition from Airbus, production issues, and regulatory scrutiny. The FAA's action on the 787 is a significant setback for Boeing, but it is not the end of the world. The company has a long history of overcoming challenges and emerging stronger. The FAA's action is a reminder that Boeing needs to focus on safety and quality, and that it needs to work closely with regulators to ensure that its planes are safe.

"So far, the slump has been more than offset by lively markets. Revenue from flipping stocks and bonds rose 15% at JPMorgan in the second quarter, year-on-year, and over 20% at Morgan Stanley, towering over shrunken deal fees. Trading and investment banking sit in the same divisions at both firms. But revenue derived from shifting securities is likely to go back roughly to where it was, especially as volatility in the bond market subsides. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been under scrutiny for its certification of the Boeing 737 Max after two deadly crashes. The FAA has been criticized for its lack of oversight and for allowing Boeing to effectively self-certify its own planes. This has led to a crisis of confidence in the FAA and in Boeing, with many questioning the safety of the 737 Max.
                The FAA has since grounded all 737 Max planes and has ordered Boeing to make changes to the plane's software. However, the damage to Boeing's reputation has already been done, and it will take time for the company to regain the trust of the flying public.
                In the meantime, other airlines are taking advantage of the situation. American Airlines, for example, has announced that it will be buying 50 new Airbus planes to replace its aging fleet of 737s. This is a major blow to Boeing, as American Airlines is one of its biggest customers.
                The grounding of the 737 Max has also had a ripple effect on the entire aviation industry. Airlines have had to cancel flights and rebook passengers, causing chaos and frustration for travelers. The FAA's decision to ground the planes has also put pressure on other aviation regulators around the world to do the same.
                In conclusion, the FAA's certification of the Boeing 737 Max has been a major setback for both the FAA and for Boeing. The FAA's lack of oversight and Boeing's self-certification of its own planes has led to a crisis of confidence in both organizations. The grounding of the 737 Max has also had a ripple effect on the entire aviation industry, causing chaos and frustration for travelers.

Shares of Lululemon rose about 2% in extended trading after the company also forecast current-quarter revenue and profit above estimates and posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings results.,"The company, which sells athletic apparel and accessories, said it expects revenue of between $1.3 billion and $1.325 billion for the current quarter, above analysts’ estimates of $1.31 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It also forecast adjusted profit of between $1.86 and $1.89 per share, compared with estimates of $1.75 per share.
                Lululemon’s first-quarter net income rose to $190.0 million, or $1.48 per share, from $145.5 million, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.43 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
                The company’s revenue rose 32% to $1.61 billion in the first quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.55 billion.
                Lululemon has been expanding its product offerings and investing in its e-commerce business to attract more customers. The company has also been opening new stores, including in international markets.
                The company’s shares have risen about 10% so far this year, outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has fallen about 13%.
                Lululemon’s strong results come as other retailers, including Target and Walmart, have reported weaker-than-expected earnings and warned of inflationary pressures. Lululemon’s focus on athletic apparel and its higher-end pricing have helped it weather the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions, analysts said.
                “Lululemon’s first-quarter results were impressive, with the company delivering strong revenue growth and earnings that beat expectations,” said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners. “The company’s focus on athletic apparel and its higher-end pricing have helped it weather the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions.”
                Feinseth added that Lululemon’s expansion into new product categories, such as footwear and personal care, and its investment in e-commerce should help drive future growth.
                Lululemon’s strong results also come as the company faces increased competition from other athletic apparel brands, including Nike and Adidas. However, Lululemon has been able to differentiate itself through its focus on community and its higher-end pricing, analysts said.

                The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday it was proposing to fine Boeing $3.9 million for allegedly installing defective parts on 737 MAX and NG planes.
                The FAA said the parts, which are slat tracks used to guide the movement of wing panels, were found to be weak and could lead to failure of the slat tracks.
                Boeing said it was aware of the proposed fine and was working with the FAA to address the issue.
                The 737 MAX has been grounded since March following two fatal crashes, and Boeing has been working to fix the plane's flight control system.
                The FAA said the proposed fine was not related to the 737 MAX crashes.
                The FAA said it had proposed the fine after an investigation found that Boeing had installed the defective parts on 133 planes, including 737 MAX and NG planes.

"For months, markets have focused on how fast central banks have been moving to curb inflation. Investors now expect the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates by 50 basis points next week, especially if U.S. consumer price data on Friday confirms elevated inflation.    ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was proposing a $161,000 civil penalty against Boeing for allegedly installing sensor systems on 737 MAX planes that were not listed in the aircraft's equipment. The FAA said the unlisted equipment could create a risk of electrical short-circuiting. Boeing said it was aware of the issue and has cooperated with the FAA. The 737 MAX was grounded for 20 months following two fatal crashes. The FAA lifted the grounding in November 2020 after Boeing made significant safety upgrades.
                The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said on Tuesday it had cleared the Boeing 737 MAX to fly again in Europe, following nearly two years of reviews after the aircraft was grounded worldwide. The EASA said it had found no issues with the aircraft's design or safety features. The 737 MAX was grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people. The EASA said it had conducted a thorough review of the aircraft's design and safety features, and had found no issues. The agency said it had worked closely with Boeing and the FAA to ensure the aircraft's safety.

He added that Boeing is working closely with the FAA and other regulators to ensure the plane's safe return to service.    The FAA's review of the 737 MAX has been a lengthy and complex process, and it is not yet clear when the plane will be cleared to fly again.

Earnings from Blackstone, Dow Chemical, Philip Morris International, Twitter and American Airlines were due on Thursday.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it was ordering a comprehensive review of the Boeing 737 MAX 8, the same type of aircraft involved in two deadly crashes in less than five months.
                The FAA said it would review all aspects of the aircraft, including its design, manufacturing and maintenance. The review will be led by the FAA's Aircraft Evaluation Group, which includes experts from the agency's certification, engineering and flight test divisions.
                The FAA's review comes after a Lion Air flight crashed into the Java Sea in October, killing all 189 people on board. On Sunday, an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board.
                The FAA said it was working closely with the National Transportation Safety Board, the Ethiopian Accident Investigation Bureau and other international safety agencies to determine the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.
                Boeing shares were down 1.5% in premarket trading.

"U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with 17 industry groups representing more than 1,000 firms in the clean energy supply chain, more than 2,000 utilities and more than 1 million American workers, a Treasury official said.","The groups included the American Petroleum Institute, the Edison Electric Institute, the National Association of Manufacturers, the Solar Energy Industries Association, the American Wind Energy Association, the American Gas Association, the American Public Power Association, the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the American Council on Renewable Energy, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, the Clean Energy Business Network, the Energy Storage Association, the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, the Geothermal Energy Association, the Hydropower Reform Coalition and the National Hydropower Association.
                The Treasury official said Yellen discussed the need for a comprehensive approach to addressing climate change, including the need for a price on carbon, and the importance of a just transition for workers and communities.
                The official said Yellen also discussed the need for a level playing field for all energy sources, including fossil fuels, and the importance of maintaining the reliability and resilience of the U.S. energy system.
                The official said Yellen emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships in driving clean energy innovation and deployment, and the need for a stable and predictable policy environment to attract private investment.
                The official said Yellen also discussed the need for a skilled and diverse workforce to support the clean energy transition, and the importance of investing in education and training programs to prepare workers for the jobs of the future.
                The official said Yellen expressed her commitment to working with industry to advance clean energy and address climate change, and looked forward to continuing the dialogue.

The RBI has been focussing on controlling inflation that has stayed above its tolerance range for an eighth straight month. The RBI targets inflation in the 2%-6% band and has hiked the repo rate by 140 basis points in the May-August period.,"The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 75 basis points, its third consecutive increase of that size and signaled that it will continue to raise rates in the coming months. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said in a statement that it decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3%-3.25%.
                The FAA has proposed a new rule that would require airlines to provide passengers with more information about the fees they charge for things like checked bags, seat assignments, and in-flight services. The FAA said the rule would help consumers make informed decisions about which airline to choose and would promote competition among airlines.

"""The lifting of travel restrictions and another relaxation of testing requirements in February came as a much needed shot of medicine after the set-back of the Omicron variant"", Hargreaves Lansdown analyst Susannah Streeter commented on Tuesday before the FTSE Russell announcement.","The FTSE Russell announcement, which is expected to be made later today, will see the index provider decide whether to include or exclude certain companies from its indices. One of the companies that is being considered for exclusion is Boeing, due to its recent troubles with the 737 MAX.
                The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been under pressure to ground the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. However, the FAA has so far resisted calls to ground the plane, citing a lack of evidence linking the crashes to a specific technical issue.
                The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has also been critical of the FAA's handling of the 737 MAX crisis, and has called for a review of the certification process for the plane. The EASA has also said that it will conduct its own tests on the 737 MAX before allowing it to fly in European airspace.
                The grounding of the 737 MAX has already cost Boeing billions of dollars, and the company is facing a number of lawsuits from families of the victims of the two crashes. The company is also facing a criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice.
                The lifting of travel restrictions and the relaxation of testing requirements are expected to boost the aviation industry, which has been hit hard by the pandemic. However, the ongoing crisis surrounding the 737 MAX is likely to continue to weigh on Boeing's share price.""

"BitChute and Odysee are hardly the only sites spreading misinformation. Social media giants such as Facebook and YouTube have also struggled to contain such content, but they have responded with more aggressive moderation policies and practices.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been criticized for its handling of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. Some have accused the agency of being too cozy with the company it is supposed to regulate.
                The FAA has been under scrutiny since the two deadly crashes of Boeing 737 MAX planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The agency has been accused of rushing the certification process for the plane and not grounding it soon enough after the first crash.
                The FAA has taken steps to address the concerns raised by the crashes. It has ordered Boeing to make changes to the plane's flight control system and has increased oversight of the company. However, some critics say that the agency's actions have been too little, too late.

CONTEXT NEWS Italy��s UniCredit on Sept. 5 unveiled a set of measures to support businesses and households battling with record energy and commodity prices. ,"The bank said it would offer a 12-month moratorium on loan repayments to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and households, as well as a 24-month loan repayment extension for SMEs. ��
                UniCredit also said it would provide a ��1 billion ($1 billion) fund to support SMEs in the transition to renewable energy sources. ��
                The measures come as Italy��s government is set to approve a new package of measures to help consumers and businesses cope with soaring energy prices. ��
                The package, which is expected to be worth around ��15 billion, will include measures to reduce energy bills for households and businesses, as well as measures to support the transition to renewable energy sources. ��
                The government is also considering measures to reduce the impact of high energy prices on the country��s industrial sector. ��
                The measures are expected to be approved by the government in the coming days. ��
                UniCredit��s measures are the latest in a series of steps taken by Italian banks to support businesses and households battling with record energy and commodity prices. ��

                The fund will provide loans and guarantees to SMEs to help them invest in renewable energy projects and reduce their energy costs. ��
                Intesa Sanpaolo also said it would offer a 12-month moratorium on loan repayments to SMEs and households, as well as a 24-month loan repayment extension for SMEs. ��
                The measures come as Italy��s industrial sector is facing significant challenges due to high energy prices. ��
                According to a recent report by the Italian employers�� federation, Confindustria, the country��s industrial sector is expected to see a 2.5% decline in output this year due to high energy prices. ��
                The report also warned that the situation could worsen if energy prices continue to rise. ��
                The Italian government has already taken a number of measures to support the industrial sector, including providing subsidies to help businesses pay their energy bills. ��
                However, the government has been criticized for not doing enough to support the sector. ��

" Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs and Citi have been keeping busy this week, updating their models, highlighting heightened risks of a U.S. recession and fuelling further nervousness across global markets in the process.  ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been under scrutiny for its role in certifying the Boeing 737 Max, which has been grounded worldwide following two deadly crashes.   The FAA has been criticized for its lack of oversight and for allowing Boeing to effectively self-certify the aircraft.   The FAA's reputation has taken a hit, and it will likely face increased scrutiny and regulation in the future.   Boeing has also been under fire for its role in the 737 Max crisis.   The company has been accused of prioritizing profits over safety and of withholding crucial information from regulators and airlines.   Boeing's reputation has been damaged, and it will likely face significant legal and financial consequences as a result of the 737 Max crisis.   The crisis has also highlighted the close relationship between the FAA and Boeing, and has raised questions about the effectiveness of the FAA's oversight of the aviation industry.   The FAA and Boeing must work to restore public trust and to ensure the safety of the aviation industry.

"** India's Adani Group has pledged shares worth about $12.5 billion in two cement units, days after the conglomerate controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani completed purchase of stakes in those businesses from Switzerland's Holcim <HOLN.S>.[nL4N30S0U8]","The group's flagship Adani Enterprises <ADEL.NS> said on Monday its subsidiaries Adani Cement and Adani Cementations have pledged 63.15% of their equity shares in Adani Cement and Adani Cementations, respectively, to the group's financial services arm Adani Finserve.**
                The pledged shares are worth about 1 trillion Indian rupees ($12.5 billion), according to a rough calculation based on the current market value of the two companies.
                The move comes after Adani Group last week completed the acquisition of Holcim's India business, which comprises Ambuja Cements <ABUJ.NS> and ACC Ltd <ACC.NS>, in a deal worth $10.5 billion.
                Adani Group, which has interests in ports, power and renewable energy, has been on an acquisition spree this year, with deals worth over $17 billion announced so far.
                The group's entry into the cement business will help it diversify its revenue streams and reduce its dependence on its core businesses, which have been hit by regulatory hurdles and a slowdown in the Indian economy.
                However, the move has raised concerns among some analysts about the group's debt levels and its ability to manage such a large and complex business.
                Adani Group has a total debt of about 2.2 trillion Indian rupees ($27.5 billion), according to data from Refinitiv.
                The group's entry into the cement business will also intensify competition in the sector, which is already facing overcapacity and weak demand.
                Adani Group's cement business will compete with established players such as UltraTech Cement <ULTC.NS>, Shree Cement <SHCM.NS> and Ramco Cements <RACC.NS>.
                The Indian cement industry has been grappling with overcapacity and weak demand for several years, with the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbating the situation.
                However, the industry is expected to recover in the coming years, driven by government spending on infrastructure and housing, and a pick-up in economic activity.
                Adani Group's entry into the cement business is seen as a positive development for the industry, as it will bring in fresh investment and competition.
                However, the group's ability to manage the business and its debt levels will be closely watched by investors and analysts.**

- A Texas jury on Tuesday found Charter Communications Inc <CHTR.O> liable for $7 billion in punitive damages after finding the cable company responsible for one of its employees who robbed and killed a customer three years ago. ,"- The jury in Dallas found that Charter Spectrum's negligence led to the death of Betty Thomas, 83, who was stabbed to death in her home in December 2019 by Roy Holden, a cable repairman who had been working for the company for several months. Holden, who was off duty, returned to Thomas' home the day after he had made a service call, using his company key card to enter her home, according to court documents.
                - The jury found Charter Spectrum 90% responsible for Thomas' death and Holden 10% responsible, according to court documents. The jury awarded Thomas' family $375 million in compensatory damages and $7 billion in punitive damages.
                - Charter Communications, which operates under the brand name Charter Spectrum, said it plans to appeal the verdict.
                - ""The responsibility for this horrible act rests solely with Mr. Holden, who was not on duty, and it is not the company's fault,"" the company said in a statement.
                - The company said it conducted a background check on Holden before he was hired and that it showed no criminal history.
                - The family's lawyers argued that Charter Spectrum failed to properly train and supervise Holden, and that the company's key card system allowed him to enter Thomas' home without her permission.
                - ""This verdict should send a message to Charter Spectrum and other companies that they need to do a better job of protecting their customers,"" said Chris Hamilton, one of the family's lawyers.
                - The verdict comes as Charter Communications is facing scrutiny over its customer service practices. The company has been fined several times by regulators for failing to provide adequate customer service.
                - In 2018, the Federal Communications Commission fined Charter Communications $2 million for failing to provide timely and accurate information to customers about its cable and internet services.
                - In 2019, the New York State Public Service Commission fined Charter Communications $2 million for failing to meet customer service standards.
                - Charter Communications is the second-largest cable company in the United States, with more than 26 million customers.

"""Oil demand ... if you look at the latest data, it's still doing OK. We were expecting some demand destruction, it did not really happen,"" said Frederic Lasserre, global head of market research and analysis at Gunvor Group <GGL.UL>. ","The International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday that global oil demand growth remained robust in the third quarter, despite soaring prices. The IEA, which advises industrialized countries on energy policy, said demand growth was 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in the third quarter, up from 1.3 million bpd in the second quarter.
                The IEA's latest monthly report also said that oil supply was ""ample"" and that there was no need for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to increase output.

                Trump has accused OPEC of keeping oil prices artificially high and has called on the group to increase output.

"""For a market that looks forward, the thought is that we're near a bottom in terms of the type of news we're getting and maybe prices have already discounted the slowdown that we're seeing,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering Boeing Co to make inspections and repairs on certain older 737 jets because of the risk of corrosion that could lead to dual engine failure.
                The FAA said the order affects 168 Boeing 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500 series airplanes worldwide, including 109 in the United States.
                The FAA said the order was prompted by a report of dual engine failure on a 737-500 series airplane in March 2009. The agency said the failure was caused by corrosion in a fuel system component.
                Boeing said it was working with the FAA to address the issue and that it had already taken steps to ensure the safety of the affected airplanes.
                The FAA said the inspections and repairs would cost about $10,000 per airplane and take about two days to complete.
                The 737 is the world's most popular jetliner, with more than 7,000 in service around the world. The 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500 series airplanes are older models that have been replaced by newer versions.
                The FAA's order comes as Boeing is facing scrutiny over the safety of its 737 MAX airplanes, which have been grounded worldwide since March following two deadly crashes in less than five months.
                Boeing has said it is working to fix the problems with the 737 MAX and that it expects the planes to be back in service by the end of the year.
                The grounding of the 737 MAX has cost Boeing billions of dollars and has led to canceled orders for the plane.
                Boeing has said it is confident that the 737 MAX will be recertified as safe to fly and that it expects the plane to be a key part of its product line for years to come.
                The company has also said it is working to improve its safety culture and to ensure that it is doing everything possible to prevent accidents.
                The FAA's order on Tuesday is not related to the 737 MAX, but it is a reminder of the importance of safety in the aviation industry.

"Brazilian oil major Petroleo Brasileiro <PETR4.SA>, or Petrobras, jumped as much as 3.2% before reversing course after the company posted a stronger-than-expected 48% surge in third-quarter profit. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it is proposing to fine Boeing Co $3.9 million for installing non-conforming components on 133 Boeing 737 MAX and NG aircraft.
                The FAA said the non-conforming components were installed on slat tracks on the leading edge of wings on the 737 MAX and NG aircraft. The FAA said the slat tracks were found to be weakened due to a condition known as hydrogen embrittlement.
                The FAA said Boeing ""failed to adequately oversee its suppliers to ensure they complied with the company's quality assurance system.""
                Boeing said it is aware of the FAA's proposed fine and is ""currently evaluating our response.""
                The FAA said the issue was discovered in 2018 and affects slat tracks on 737 MAX and NG aircraft produced by Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems.
                The FAA said Boeing has agreed to replace the non-conforming components on the affected aircraft.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is not related to the two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX that led to the plane's grounding in March.
                The FAA said it is continuing to review Boeing's proposed changes to the 737 MAX and has not yet set a date for the plane's return to service.
                The FAA said it is working closely with international regulators to ensure the 737 MAX is safe to fly before it is allowed to return to service.
                The FAA said it is also working with Boeing to ensure the company's quality assurance system is effective and that suppliers are complying with it.
                The FAA said it is committed to ensuring the safety of the flying public and will take all necessary actions to ensure the 737 MAX is safe to fly before it is allowed to return to service.

                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive following a United Airlines flight on Saturday that was forced to return to Denver International Airport after its right engine failed.
                The directive requires immediate or stepped-up inspections of the fan blades in the engines, which are used only on Boeing 777s.
                Boeing said it supported the decision to ground the planes.
                ""While the investigation is ongoing, we recommended suspending operations of the 69 in-service and 59 in-storage 777s powered by Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines until the FAA identifies the appropriate inspection protocol,"" Boeing said in a statement.
                United Airlines, the only U.S. operator of the 777s with the Pratt & Whitney engines, had already voluntarily grounded its fleet of 24 planes.
                Japan's transport ministry ordered Japan Airlines Co Ltd (JAL) and ANA Holdings Inc to suspend the use of 777s with Pratt & Whitney 4000-112 engines while it considered whether to take additional measures.
                JAL and ANA together operate 32 of the planes with the engines in question, according to the ministry.
                The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was aware of the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive and was in contact with U.S. authorities.
                ""EASA is currently assessing the situation and any further action if required will be communicated in due course,"" a spokeswoman said.
                Pratt & Whitney, which is owned by Raytheon Technologies Corp, said it was coordinating with operators and regulators to support a revised inspection interval for the engines.
                ""We are working to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to support the continued safe operation of the fleet,"" the company said in a statement.

"One way of quantifying the hit is to look at how much higher energy bills will be, based on forward gas prices. Utilities analysts at Goldman Sachs calculate customers will have to pay 1.3 trillion euros more next year than last year �C even if prices are capped at a level that stops power generators making excess profits.","The European Commission has proposed a cap on the revenue of power generators that use gas, and a windfall tax on oil, gas and coal companies. The aim is to raise 140 billion euros to help households and businesses pay their bills. But the plan has been criticized by some countries, including France and Spain, which say it does not go far enough.
                The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed new rules for commercial space transportation, which would require companies to provide more information about their operations and safety records. The FAA says the changes are needed to ensure the safety of the growing number of commercial space launches.
                Boeing has announced it will cut production of its 787 Dreamliner aircraft by about half, due to a combination of supply chain problems and regulatory delays. The company says it will produce only five of the planes per month, down from the current rate of 10.
                The European Central Bank (ECB) has raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points, in an effort to combat inflation. The move was widely expected, but it is still the largest rate hike in the ECB's history.
                The International Energy Agency (IEA) has warned that Europe faces a ""significant risk"" of power outages this winter, due to a combination of low gas storage levels and reduced Russian gas supplies. The IEA says European countries need to take urgent action to reduce demand and increase supplies.

"While NASA and White House officials have acknowledged the existence of contingency plans before, they have avoided discussing them in public to avoid inflaming tensions with Russia.

                The U.S. and Russia have a long history of cooperation in space, dating back to the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. But the relationship has become increasingly strained in recent years, particularly after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.
                In response to Russia's actions in Ukraine, the U.S. and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia, including restrictions on technology transfers. Russia, in turn, has threatened to stop supplying rocket engines to the U.S.
                The tensions have raised concerns about the future of the International Space Station, which is a joint project of NASA, Roscosmos, and space agencies from several other countries. The station is currently scheduled to operate until at least 2024, but its long-term future is uncertain.
                The situation has also highlighted the need for the U.S. to develop its own capability to launch astronauts into space. NASA has been working with private companies, including Boeing and SpaceX, to develop new spacecraft for this purpose. But the first launches of these spacecraft have been delayed, and it is not clear when they will be ready to carry astronauts.
                In the meantime, NASA has been buying seats on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to and from the space station. The last such launch took place in October, and the next one is scheduled for March.

"""We maybe have a bit less chaos with Boris Johnson not running but it's not like Rishi Sunak has a strong programme presenting greater horizons ahead for the UK economy when the backdrop is still the backdrop,"" said John Hardy head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering a temporary grounding of Boeing 787 Dreamliners powered by certain Rolls-Royce engines following an engine failure in South Carolina last week.
                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to address a potential issue with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engine package C.
                The directive requires operators to inspect the engines for potential fatigue cracking of the intermediate-pressure compressor (IPC) blades.
                The FAA said the inspections must be done within nine flight cycles of the directive's effective date, which was not immediately clear.
                The directive covers 18 Boeing 787 Dreamliners worldwide, including 13 in the United States, the FAA said.
                Boeing and Rolls-Royce did not immediately comment.
                The FAA said the order was in response to an engine failure on a Boeing 787-9 operated by Air New Zealand on a flight from Auckland to Tokyo on November 27.
                The FAA said the engine failure was caused by a fatigue crack in the IPC blades.
                The FAA said it was working with Rolls-Royce and Boeing to develop a permanent fix for the issue.
                The FAA said it was also working with international aviation authorities to ensure the safety of the Boeing 787 fleet.
                The FAA said it was not aware of any other engine failures related to the issue.

The order could affect 165 planes in the United States and 1,050 worldwide, the FAA said.
                The FAA said it had not yet determined the cause of the cracks, but that they were not related to the grounding of the 737 MAX after two fatal crashes.
                Boeing said it was aware of the issue and was working with the FAA to address it.
                The FAA's order comes as Boeing faces intense scrutiny over the safety of its planes following the two crashes involving the 737 MAX, which killed 346 people.
                The MAX has been grounded since March, and Boeing has been working to fix a software issue that has been linked to the crashes.
                The FAA's order is not related to the MAX grounding, but it is another setback for Boeing as it tries to regain the trust of regulators and the flying public.
                The FAA said it would order inspections of certain 737 NG planes, including the 737-700, 737-800 and 737-900 models.
                The inspections will be required within seven days of the order being issued, the FAA said.
                Boeing said it was working with the FAA to address the issue and that it would provide more information to customers and operators as soon as possible.
                The FAA's order is the latest in a series of setbacks for Boeing, which has been under intense scrutiny since the two MAX crashes.
                The company has been working to fix the software issue that has been linked to the crashes, and it has also been dealing with the fallout from the grounding of the MAX.
                The MAX grounding has cost Boeing billions of dollars, and it has also damaged the company's reputation.
                Boeing has been working to regain the trust of regulators and the flying public, but the FAA's order is a reminder that the company still has work to do.
                The FAA's order is not expected to have a significant impact on Boeing's operations, but it is another setback for the company as it tries to move past the MAX grounding.

"Other tech giants such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O> and Intel Corp <INTC.O> also issued bonds earlier this week, raising $5.5 billion and $6 billion, respectively.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it will order inspection of some Boeing <BA.N> 737 planes that have been in storage due to the coronavirus pandemic.
                The FAA said the order will require operators to inspect and potentially replace a key part on the planes, which have been parked due to a drop in travel demand.
                The order will affect about 2,000 planes in the United States, the FAA said.
                Boeing said it supports the FAA's decision and will work with its customers to ensure the inspections are carried out.
                The FAA's order comes as Boeing and other aerospace companies are facing significant financial pressure due to the pandemic.
                The company has been forced to cut production and lay off thousands of workers as a result of the drop in demand for air travel.
                Boeing has also been dealing with the fallout from two fatal crashes involving its 737 MAX planes, which have been grounded since March 2019.
                The company has been working to get the planes back in the air, but the process has been delayed by regulatory hurdles and concerns about the safety of the aircraft.
                The FAA's order is the latest setback for Boeing, which has been struggling to recover from the 737 MAX crisis.
                The company has been working to restore its reputation and regain the trust of regulators and the flying public.
                The FAA's order is a reminder of the challenges that Boeing and other aerospace companies are facing as they try to navigate the pandemic and its aftermath.

"Shares of Tower Semiconductor <TSEM.O>, which agreed in February to sell itself to Intel Corp for $5.4 billion, were down 4% on Wednesday afternoon at $41.31, a significant discount to the $53 per share deal price, reflecting doubt among investors over whether the transaction will be completed.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it is proposing a $19.7 million civil penalty against Boeing Co for allegedly installing equipment on 759 Boeing 737 planes that contained sensors that had not been tested.
                The FAA said the equipment, a head-up guidance system, was installed on planes between June 2015 and April 2019. The system provides flight information to pilots during the most critical phases of flight.
                The FAA said Boeing ""allegedly failed to follow its own production procedures and installed the head-up guidance system on 759 aircraft without performing required testing.""
                Boeing said it is aware of the FAA's proposed penalty and is ""currently evaluating next steps.""
                The FAA said Boeing has 30 days to respond to the proposed penalty. The agency said the proposed penalty is not related to the two fatal 737 MAX crashes that led to the plane's grounding in March 2019.
                The FAA said the proposed penalty is the largest it has ever proposed against Boeing. The previous largest proposed penalty was $12 million in 2015 for allegedly installing non-conforming parts on 737 planes.

"""Some cracks are beginning to appear in the labor market,"" writes Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at CGC. ""Hiring is slowing and downsizing events are beginning to occur.""","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has proposed a new rule that would require airlines to inspect their planes for cracks every 1,000 flights. This is in response to a series of incidents where cracks were found on Boeing 737s. The FAA says that the new rule would help prevent accidents and ensure the safety of passengers.
                The FAA has been criticized for not doing enough to ensure the safety of passengers. Some have called for the agency to be abolished and replaced with a new organization that is more focused on safety.
                The FAA has been under fire for its handling of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. The agency has been accused of being too cozy with Boeing and not doing enough to ensure the safety of passengers.

                The FAA said it was ordering the temporary grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft operated by U.S. airlines or in a U.S. territory. The agency said it would issue an emergency order to ground the planes.
                The FAA said it was taking this action as a result of the data gathering process and new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today. This evidence, together with newly refined satellite data available to FAA this morning, led to this decision.
                The FAA said it was working with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and other authorities to investigate the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed all 157 people on board.
                The FAA said it was also working with Boeing and other civil aviation authorities as they continue their investigation into the Lion Air Flight 610 crash, which killed all 189 people on board in October.

"Citigroup declined to comment on Friday, but on Thursday, the bank said in a filing it will continue to reduce its operations and exposures to Russia. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it will require Boeing to make additional design changes to the 737 MAX before the plane can return to service.
                The FAA said it had identified a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate.
                Boeing said it agreed with the FAA's decision and is working on the necessary changes.

                EASA said it was still reviewing the FAA's decision and would make its own determination in due course.
                Russia's Aeroflot said on Friday it had suspended all flights of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft.
                Aeroflot said it was working closely with Boeing and the FAA to ensure the safety of its passengers and crew.
                The Russian airline said it had taken the decision to suspend flights of the 737 MAX as a precautionary measure.
                Aeroflot said it would continue to monitor the situation closely and would make further announcements as necessary.

"For now, though, AmEx is benefiting from bottled-up demand and the easing of COVID-19 curbs that have sparked the strongest summer travel season since the start of the pandemic. ","The company, which is the largest issuer of corporate credit cards, said it expects topline growth of 18% to 20% in 2022, up from a prior forecast of 15% to 17%.  AmEx also raised its full-year earnings forecast to a range of $9.50 to $9.70 per share, from $9.25 to $9.55 per share.
                The New York-based company's shares rose 3.5% in premarket trading.
                The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday it was proposing to fine Boeing $19.7 million for allegedly installing equipment on 759 Boeing 737 planes that contained sensors that had not been tested.
                The FAA said the equipment, known as angle of attack sensors, were installed on planes between June 2015 and June 2019. The sensors provide data to the aircraft's flight control system to help prevent the plane from stalling.
                Boeing said it was aware of the FAA's proposed fine and was reviewing the matter.
                The FAA said Boeing had agreed to pay the fine and take corrective action.
                The FAA has been investigating Boeing's 737 production since 2019, after two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX.
                The crashes, which killed 346 people, led to the grounding of the 737 MAX for 20 months and prompted a series of investigations into Boeing's design and production processes.
                The FAA lifted the grounding in November 2020, after Boeing made changes to the plane's flight control system.
                The FAA's proposed fine is the latest in a series of penalties imposed on Boeing in recent years.
                In January, the company agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle a criminal charge related to the 737 MAX crashes.
                In December, the FAA proposed fining Boeing $5.4 million for allegedly installing faulty parts on 737 MAX and 737 NG planes.
                Boeing has said it is committed to improving its safety culture and has taken a series of steps to address the issues raised by the 737 MAX crashes.

                The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has announced that it will be grounding all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in the United States.

The FAA said that it made the decision after reviewing new evidence from the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on March 10.
                The FAA's decision to ground the 737 MAX is a major blow to Boeing, which has seen its stock price plummet in recent weeks.

Moderna's shares fell 1% to $130.98 in early trading.    (Reporting by Manas Mishra and Leroy Leo in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Sriraj Kalluvila)  ((Manas.Mishra@thomsonreuters.com; www.twitter.com/Manaswrites15; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780)),"The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering immediate inspections of Boeing 777 planes with Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines after a United Airlines flight suffered an engine failure on Saturday.
                The FAA said on Tuesday it had issued an emergency airworthiness directive that would require operators to inspect fan blades in PW4000 engines before they can be used for flights.
                The directive applies to Boeing 777s equipped with PW4000-112 engines, which are used solely by United Airlines and its units in the United States and by Japan's two main airlines, Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc.
                The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Monday that a preliminary investigation showed two fan blades in the United Airlines engine were fractured - one was fractured near the root and the other was fractured at the midpoint.
                The NTSB said the Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines were used on less than 10% of the global Boeing 777 fleet.
                Boeing said it supported the FAA's inspection requirements and was working through the process with its customers.
                Pratt & Whitney, owned by Raytheon Technologies Corp, said it was coordinating all actions with Boeing, airlines and regulators, and that it was conducting a thorough investigation of the engine failure.
                United Airlines said on Monday it had voluntarily removed 24 Boeing 777 aircraft powered by PW4000 engines from its schedule.
                Japan's transport ministry ordered Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc to ground all 777s with PW4000 engines.
                The ministry said it had ordered the two airlines to suspend all flights using the aircraft until further notice.
                The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was aware of the FAA's emergency airworthiness directive and was in contact with the FAA and Boeing.
                EASA said it was assessing the situation and would take any necessary action to ensure the safety of flights in Europe.
                The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said it was monitoring the situation closely and was in contact with regulators and airlines.
                IATA said it was too early to assess the impact of the incident on the aviation industry.

                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to require the inspection of certain Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.
                The FAA said the AD requires operators to inspect fan blade roots on certain Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines and remove from service any fan blades that fail the inspection.
                The FAA said the AD was prompted by a recent engine failure on a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.
                The FAA said the engine failure occurred during a flight from Charleston, South Carolina, to London on January 17.
                The FAA said the engine failure was caused by a fan blade that separated from the engine.
                The FAA said the fan blade separation was the result of high-cycle fatigue cracking.
                The FAA said the AD applies to all Boeing 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliners powered by certain Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.
                The FAA said the AD requires initial and recurring inspections of the fan blade roots on the affected engines.
                The FAA said the initial inspections must be completed within 30 days of the effective date of the AD.
                The FAA said the recurring inspections must be completed at intervals not to exceed 1,000 flight cycles.
                The FAA said the AD is effective immediately.
                The FAA said the AD affects 128 engines installed on 68 Boeing 787 Dreamliners worldwide.
                The FAA said the AD is expected to cost $1.8 million.
                The FAA said the AD is necessary to address the unsafe condition of high-cycle fatigue cracking in the fan blade roots on certain Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.
                The FAA said the AD is expected to prevent engine failures and ensure the continued safe operation of the affected Boeing 787 Dreamliners.
                The FAA said the AD is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
                The FAA said the AD is not expected to have a significant impact on the environment.
                The FAA said the AD is not expected to have a significant impact on the quality of the human environment.

                The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering the temporary grounding of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft operated by U.S. airlines or in U.S. territory following a second deadly crash involving the plane in less than five months.
                The FAA said it made the decision as a result of the data gathering process and new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today.
                The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) also suspended all flights in the bloc by the Boeing 737 MAX.
                Boeing said it had decided to ground the flights ""out of an abundance of caution and in order to reassure the flying public of the aircraft's safety.""
                The grounding of the 737 MAX aircraft in the United States and Europe follows similar moves by other countries and airlines around the world.

"""The pound rally yesterday has fully reversed as investors conclude the resignation of Liz Truss as prime minister does not necessarily mean political uncertainty will be removed,"" noted MUFG head of global markets research for EMEA Derek Halpenny.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Thursday it was grounding all Boeing 737 MAX jets in the United States, a day after a second deadly crash involving the model in less than five months.
                The FAA said it was ordering the temporary grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft operated by U.S. airlines or in U.S. territory.
                The decision came after the agency said it had received new evidence in the form of satellite data and physical evidence that showed similarities between the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on Sunday and a Lion Air flight in October.
                The FAA said it was working with Boeing and other civil aviation authorities as investigations into the crashes continue.
                The grounding affects 737 MAX jets operated by U.S. airlines, including Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines.
                The FAA said it was also ordering the temporary grounding of all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft operated by foreign airlines in U.S. territory.
                The decision to ground the planes came after several countries, including China, Indonesia, and Ethiopia, had already grounded the planes.

","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was still reviewing public comments on its draft environmental impact statement for the SpaceX Starship Super Heavy project in Boca Chica, Texas.
                The FAA said it will not make a decision on the project until it has completed its review of public comments and any necessary consultations.
                The FAA said it received more than 18,000 comments on the draft environmental impact statement.
                The FAA in September 2021 had expected to complete the environmental review by the end of December 2021 but in December it delayed the completion to the end of February.
                SpaceX did not immediately comment.
                The FAA in 2021 approved SpaceX's proposal to build its Super Heavy rocket and Starship spacecraft at its Boca Chica site in Texas, but the company still needs an FAA license to launch the spacecraft.
                The FAA said it is also working with SpaceX to address a number of outstanding issues related to the project, including the potential impact on nearby residents and the environment.
                The FAA said it will continue to work with SpaceX to ensure that the company's operations at Boca Chica are safe and comply with all applicable regulations.
                Boeing Co (BA.N) said on Tuesday it delivered 22 airplanes in May, up from 17 a year earlier, and the U.S. planemaker also reported 35 new orders.
                The deliveries included 17 737 MAX jets, two 787s and one 767, Boeing said.
                The new orders included 23 737 MAX jets, five 787s and seven 777s.
                Boeing's order book was hit by the cancellation of 17 orders for the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March 2019 following two fatal crashes.
                The company's total order backlog stood at 4,231 airplanes as of the end of May.
                Boeing's deliveries have been hit by the grounding of the 737 MAX and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hurt demand for air travel.
                The company has been working to get the 737 MAX back in the air, and it has also been working to address quality issues with the 787 Dreamliner.
                Boeing's shares were up 1.5% in early trading on Tuesday.

"Under II-VI's offer terms made in March 2021, Coherent stockholders will receive $220 in cash and 0.91 II-VI shares, which valued Coherent at about $7 billion at the time. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it is proposing to fine Boeing $19.7 million for allegedly installing equipment on 759 Boeing 737 MAX and NG aircraft that contained sensors that were not listed in the aircraft's equipment list or the flight manual.
                The FAA said the sensors, known as ""angle of attack"" sensors, provide information about the angle at which the aircraft's nose is pointing relative to the oncoming air. The sensors were installed on 618 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and 141 Boeing 737 NG aircraft.
                The FAA said the sensors were not listed in the aircraft's equipment list or the flight manual, which could have resulted in the pilots not being aware of their existence or function.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of an investigation that began in 2019 after Boeing disclosed the issue to the agency.
                The FAA said Boeing has 30 days to respond to the proposed fine.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is not related to the two fatal crashes involving the 737 MAX that occurred in 2018 and 2019.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the largest ever proposed by the agency against Boeing.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of a comprehensive review of Boeing's quality control and production processes.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of a thorough investigation that included interviews with Boeing employees and a review of Boeing's internal documents.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of a rigorous enforcement process that is designed to ensure that aircraft manufacturers comply with all applicable regulations.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of a commitment to safety that is the top priority of the agency.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of a determination that Boeing's actions in this case were unacceptable and warrant the imposition of a significant penalty.
                The FAA said the proposed fine is the result of a belief that the imposition of a significant penalty is necessary to deter similar conduct in the future.

"Goldman Sachs cut its 2023 oil price forecast on Tuesday, due to expectations of weaker demand and a stronger U.S. dollar but said global supply disappointments only reinforced its long-term bullish outlook.","The investment bank lowered its 2023 Brent price forecast by $10 to $85 a barrel and its 2023 U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price forecast by $10 to $80 a barrel.

"The OPEC+ producer group agreed this week to raise its oil output goal by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) in September, but this was one of the smallest increases since such quotas were introduced in 1982, OPEC data showed. [nL1N2ZF13I]","The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, are unwinding record output cuts of about 10 million bpd imposed in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic slashed demand.
                The group had increased its target by about 430,000-650,000 bpd in recent months, as part of a gradual easing of the cuts. The small increase for September was seen as a way to placate consumer nations, which have been calling on OPEC+ to do more to cool prices.
                The OPEC+ decision came after U.S. President Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest member, last month. Biden had urged the group to increase production to help lower prices at the pump.
                The OPEC+ agreement on Wednesday followed a meeting in which the group also agreed to appoint a new secretary general, Kuwait's Haitham al-Ghais, to replace Nigeria's Mohammad Barkindo, who died last month.
                The group's next meeting is set for Sept. 5.

Biden had urged the group to increase production to help lower prices at the pump.\n                The OPEC+ agreement on Wednesday followed a meeting in which the group also agreed to appoint a new secretary general, Kuwait's Haitham al-Ghais, to replace Nigeria's Mohammad Barkindo, who died last month.\n                The group's next meeting is set for Sept. 5.\n\nOutput:\n[\n  {'end': 55, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 51, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC'},\n  {'end': 61, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 58, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC+'},\n  {'end': 115, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 111, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC+'},\n  {'end': 122, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 119, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'Russia'},\n  {'end': 128, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 125, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC+'},\n  {'end': 184, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 180, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC+'},\n  {'end': 191, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 188, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC+'},\n  {'end': 198, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 195, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'OPEC+'},\n  {'end': 204, 'label': 'Neutral', 'start': 201, 'tag': 'Neutral', 'value': 'O"", role='assistant', tool_calls=None, function_call=None))], usage=Usage(completion_tokens=512, prompt_tokens=370, total_tokens=882, completion_tokens_details=None, prompt_tokens_details=None), service_tier=None, prompt=[])",[]

"The S&P/ASX 200 <.AXJO> closed 0.4% higher at 6,650.60 points, extending gains to a third consecutive session. The benchmark had risen 0.2% on Wednesday.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Wednesday it was mandating Boeing (BA.N) to make additional design changes to the 737 MAX's flight control system, which could take until the end of the year to complete.
                The FAA said it was requiring Boeing to install a ""software update"" to the MAX's flight control system, which has been linked to two fatal crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.
                The FAA said the software update would address a ""potential failure mode"" in the MAX's flight control system, which could cause the plane to pitch down unexpectedly.
                The FAA's announcement came after Boeing said it had completed a software update for the MAX's flight control system, which it said would make the plane safer.
                The FAA said it was also requiring Boeing to make changes to the MAX's flight manual, which would provide pilots with more information about the plane's flight control system.
                The FAA's announcement is the latest setback for Boeing, which has been under intense scrutiny since the two fatal crashes.
                The MAX has been grounded worldwide since March, and Boeing has been working to get the plane back in the air.
                The FAA's announcement is a blow to Boeing, which had hoped to get the MAX back in the air by the end of the year.
                The FAA's announcement is also a setback for airlines, which have been forced to cancel flights and rebook passengers because of the grounding.
                The FAA's announcement is the latest in a series of setbacks for Boeing, which has been under intense scrutiny since the two fatal crashes.

"Banks looked set to extend their climb higher, with Bank of America <BAC.N> up 1% in premarket trading, while megacap growth and technology stocks that led the overnight rally were mixed.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was grounding all Boeing 777-200s with the same type of engine that suffered a failure over Denver this weekend.
                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive that would require immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes with certain Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engines.
                Boeing said it supported the FAA's decision to ground the 777s with the PW4000 engines and that it was working with regulators to address the issue.
                The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said it was in contact with the FAA and monitoring the situation, but had not yet decided whether to take action.
                The Denver incident followed a similar one in Japan in December, when a Pratt & Whitney engine on a Boeing 777 operated by Japan Airlines failed, causing debris to fall over a residential area near Tokyo.
                Boeing shares were down 2.9% in premarket trading.

"""Companies are reporting increasing headwinds from the rising cost of living, tightening financial conditions �C notably higher borrowing costs �C and weakened demand across both home and export markets,"" writes Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering a temporary grounding of Boeing 787 Dreamliners powered by certain Rolls-Royce engines after an engine failure on an Air New Zealand flight last week.
                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to require operators to inspect the engines on the affected planes within 10 days.
                The directive affects 787s powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines, the FAA said.
                The FAA said the directive was prompted by an engine failure on an Air New Zealand flight from Auckland to Tokyo on December 27.
                The FAA said the engine failure was caused by a problem with the intermediate pressure compressor (IPC) blades.
                The FAA said the inspection would require a visual inspection of the IPC blades and a borescope inspection of the IPC case.
                The FAA said the inspection would take about four hours per engine.
                The FAA said it was working with Rolls-Royce and Boeing to develop a permanent fix for the problem.

"With the coming of cooler autumn weather, Refinitiv projected average U.S. gas demand, including exports, would slip from 93.9 bcfd this week to 93.7 bcfd next week. Those forecasts were higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Tuesday.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday projected U.S. gas demand, including exports, would average 93.9 bcfd this week and 93.7 bcfd next week. That compares with Refinitiv's current demand projection of 93.9 bcfd this week and 93.7 bcfd next week.
                Refinitiv, a global provider of financial markets data and infrastructure, said its latest gas demand forecast was higher than its outlook on Tuesday due to an expected increase in heating demand in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast.
                The EIA also said it expects U.S. gas production to average 91.4 bcfd this week and 91.3 bcfd next week, down from 91.5 bcfd this week and 91.4 bcfd next week in its outlook on Tuesday.
                The EIA's latest gas production forecast was lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Tuesday due to a decrease in production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
                The EIA is the statistical and analytical agency within the U.S. Department of Energy. It provides policy-independent data, forecasts, and analyses to promote sound policy making, efficient markets, and public understanding regarding energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment.

"Apollo said its private equity portfolio appreciated by 8% in the first quarter. The private equity funds of Blackstone and Carlyle rose by 2.8% and 7%, respectively, while those of KKR fell 5% in the same period.","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it will order inspections of some Boeing 737 planes after an EgyptAir jet crashed last month. The FAA said the inspections will focus on the plane's tail, where the crash occurred.

                The FAA said it is working with Boeing to develop a plan to inspect the planes. The inspections will be conducted by Boeing and the FAA will oversee the process.

                The FAA said it is too early to determine the cause of the crash, but it is working closely with Egyptian authorities to investigate the incident.

                The FAA's decision to order inspections comes after Boeing recommended the inspections last week. Boeing said the inspections are necessary to ensure the safety of the planes.

                The FAA's order will affect about 200 planes worldwide, including about 100 in the United States. The inspections are expected to take several weeks to complete.

                The FAA's decision to order inspections is a precautionary measure, and there is no evidence that the crash was caused by a problem with the plane's tail.

                The FAA's order is the latest setback for Boeing, which has been plagued by problems with its 737 planes in recent years. In 2019, Boeing grounded its entire fleet of 737 MAX planes after two deadly crashes.

                The FAA's order is a blow to Boeing, which has been working to restore confidence in its 737 planes. The company has been working to fix the problems with the 737 MAX planes, and it had hoped to resume deliveries of the planes this year.

                The FAA's order is a reminder that safety is the top priority for the agency, and it will not hesitate to take action to ensure the safety of the flying public.

                The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March 2019, following the second crash. The grounding has cost Boeing billions of dollars and has led to the resignation of the company's CEO, Dennis Muilenburg.

But BCA says inflationary pressures remain relatively tame in Japan. The headline index grew 2.6% year-on-year in July -- significantly lower than other developed market economies where inflation rates are closer to double digits. ,"The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has been trying to boost inflation for years, but with limited success. The central bank's latest policy meeting is set to conclude on Thursday, and analysts expect it to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy.
                The BOJ's efforts to stimulate the economy have helped support the country's stock market, with the Nikkei 225 index up around 10% so far this year. However, the weak yen has been a major headwind for Japanese companies, as it makes their products more expensive overseas.
                One such company is Toyota, which has warned that the strong dollar is hurting its profits. The automaker said last week that it expects to post an operating profit of 2.4 trillion yen ($17.8 billion) for the current financial year, down from a previous forecast of 2.8 trillion yen.
                Despite the challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about Japan's economic outlook. ""We believe that the Japanese economy is on a solid footing, with a strong labor market and rising wages,"" said Hiroshi Shiraishi, senior economist at BNP Paribas.
                ""The BOJ's monetary policy is also providing support, and we expect the central bank to maintain its current stance for the foreseeable future,"" he added.

"But for those looking for an equity market bottom, Chris Haverland, global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute (WFII), makes the following observation:","“The S&P 500 has fallen 20% or more from its peak in 12 of the past 13 recessions, with an average decline of 31%,” he said. “The S&P 500 is currently down 23% from its peak, so it’s possible that we have further to go.”

                The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been criticized for its handling of the Boeing 737 MAX crisis. The FAA has been accused of being too cozy with Boeing and not doing enough to ensure the safety of the aircraft. The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 following two deadly crashes.

                The FAA has been working to address the issues with the 737 MAX, but it has been a slow process. The agency has been criticized for not moving quickly enough to certify the fixes that Boeing has proposed. The FAA has also been criticized for not being transparent about the certification process.

                Boeing has been working to fix the issues with the 737 MAX, but it has been a difficult and costly process. The company has had to pay billions of dollars in compensation to airlines and families of the victims of the crashes. Boeing has also had to cut production of the 737 MAX and has seen its reputation damaged.

"Brent crude futures <LCOc1> rose 60 cents, or 0.7%, to $91.95 a barrel by 0330 GMT after settling up 0.5% on Friday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude <CLc1> was at $85.50 a barrel, up 39 cents, or 0.5%. The front-month contract expires on Tuesday. ","The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, agreed last week to lower their output target by 2 million barrels per day.  The decision has drawn criticism from the United States, which President Joe Biden visited Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader, earlier this year.
                The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Friday it was requiring immediate inspections of Boeing 737s after a China Eastern Airlines plane with 132 people on board crashed in March. The FAA said the inspections would focus on a key valve in the planes' tail section.
                The FAA said it was aware of 22 Boeing 737s worldwide that had experienced malfunctions of the valve, which is used to control the plane's pitch.
                Boeing said it was working with the FAA and airlines to address the issue.
                The FAA said it was also requiring airlines to replace the valve if it malfunctions more than once.
                The FAA's action comes after China's aviation regulator ordered inspections of all Boeing 737s in the country following the crash.
                The cause of the crash is still under investigation.
                The FAA's action is the latest setback for Boeing, which has been grappling with safety concerns over its 737 MAX planes following two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019.
                The MAX planes were grounded worldwide for nearly two years after the crashes, which killed 346 people.
                Boeing has since made changes to the MAX planes' flight control system and they have been cleared to fly again by regulators around the world.
                However, the company is still facing lawsuits from families of the crash victims and investigations by regulators and lawmakers.
                The FAA's action is not expected to have a significant impact on Boeing's production or deliveries of 737s, as the inspections can be done during routine maintenance.
                However, it is another reminder of the challenges Boeing faces as it tries to move past the MAX crisis and restore its reputation.

"""Looking ahead, industrial production will have a relatively tough time growing in an economic environment of high inflation, rising interest rates, persistent supply chain problems, and weakening domestic demand,"" says Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at OE. ","The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said on Tuesday it was ordering a temporary grounding of Boeing 787 Dreamliners powered by certain Rolls-Royce engines following an engine failure on an Air New Zealand flight last week.
                The FAA said it was issuing an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to require operators of Boeing 787s with Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines to conduct inspections of the engines.
                The FAA said the AD was prompted by an engine failure on a Boeing 787-9 operated by Air New Zealand on a flight from Auckland to Tokyo on November 1.
                The FAA said the engine failure was caused by a fatigue crack in a turbine blade.
                The FAA said the AD requires operators to conduct inspections of the engines within 10 days of the directive's effective date.
                The FAA said the AD affects 137 engines installed on 68 Boeing 787 aircraft worldwide.

"The EMEA DC, which helps apply the terms of CDS contracts to specific cases, determined on June 1 that a ""failure to pay credit event"" had occurred after Russia failed to add accrued interest on a payment made earlier this year. ","The EMEA DC, which is a committee of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), made the determination after a group of bondholders said Russia was in default.
                The ISDA's determinations committee, which is made up of 15 dealers and includes JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, said in a statement that it had received a question about whether a failure to pay credit event had occurred with respect to Russia.
                The committee determined that a failure to pay credit event had occurred on May 27, when Russia did not add accrued interest to a payment it made on April 4.
                The ISDA's determinations committee is responsible for applying the terms of CDS contracts to specific cases.
                The committee's determination means that holders of credit default swaps linked to Russia can now seek payment.
                Credit default swaps are a type of financial derivative that allow investors to buy protection against the risk of default on bonds or other debt instruments.
                The ISDA is a trade organization that represents participants in the market for over-the-counter derivatives.
                The organization's determinations committee is made up of dealers who are members of the ISDA.
                The committee's determination that a failure to pay credit event has occurred with respect to Russia is likely to have a negative impact on the country's creditworthiness.
                The determination is also likely to increase the cost of borrowing for Russia, as investors demand higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk of default.
                The ISDA's determinations committee is a key player in the market for credit default swaps.
                The committee's determination that a failure to pay credit event has occurred with respect to Russia is likely to have a significant impact on the market for CDS linked to the country.

"But zooming out, it might be a good idea to gear up for a broad semiconductor down cycle, says Amit Chanda, equity sector analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ","The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, and the current up cycle has been going on for a long time, Chanda says.  The industry has been in an up cycle since 2016, and it’s been a strong one, he adds.
                The semiconductor industry is a key supplier to many other industries, including automotive, industrial, and technology.  A downturn in the semiconductor industry could have a ripple effect on these other industries.
                The semiconductor industry is also facing some headwinds, including the U.S.-China trade war and the slowdown in the global economy.  These headwinds could lead to a downturn in the semiconductor industry, Chanda says.
                Investors should consider reducing their exposure to semiconductor stocks, Chanda says.  He recommends looking for other areas of the market that are less cyclical and have more stable earnings.

Meta in July sought the opinion of its independent oversight board on changes to its current approach given the improvement in authentic information sources and general awareness around COVID.,"The board, which includes former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the former head of Denmark's security and intelligence services, recommended that Meta continue to remove false claims about COVID and vaccines, but to be more cautious about removing posts that are not clearly false.
                The board also recommended that Meta provide more information about its rules and how it enforces them, and that it be more transparent about the data it uses to make decisions about content.
                The board's recommendations are not binding, but Meta has said it will consider them carefully.
                The board's recommendations come as Meta faces increasing scrutiny over its handling of misinformation and disinformation on its platforms.
                In recent months, the company has been criticized for allowing false claims about COVID and vaccines to spread on its platforms, and for not doing enough to stop the spread of disinformation about the 2020 U.S. presidential election.
                Meta has said it is taking steps to address these issues, including by expanding its fact-checking program and by providing more resources to help users find accurate information.
