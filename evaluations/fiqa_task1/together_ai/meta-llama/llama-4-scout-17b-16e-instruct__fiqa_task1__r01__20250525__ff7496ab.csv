- The sentence is: ""G4S slides on balance sheet worries.""
- The target aspect is: G4S
- The context indicates a negative sentiment because ""slides"" implies a decline and ""balance sheet worries"" implies financial concerns.

Given that the sentiment is negative and there's no extremely strong negative language (like ""crashes,"" ""disaster,"" etc.), but rather a mention of a decline due to worries, we can infer a moderate negative sentiment.

A sentiment score of -1 represents an extremely negative sentiment, and 0 represents a neutral sentiment.
