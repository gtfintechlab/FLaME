# A Deep Analysis of the Allen Institute for AI\'s OLMES Evaluation Framework

## I. OLMES: Advancing Reproducible LLM Evaluation {#i.-olmes-advancing-reproducible-llm-evaluation}

### A. Core Mission and Design Philosophy {#a.-core-mission-and-design-philosophy}

The Open Language Model Evaluation System (OLMES) represents a
significant effort by the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) to standardize
and enhance the evaluation methodologies for large language models
(LLMs). Developed within AI2\'s Open Language Model initiative, OLMES
serves as the internal framework for assessing the performance of both
foundational (base) and instruction-following (instruct-tuned) models
across a diverse set of tasks. It has been instrumental in the
evaluation pipelines for prominent AI2 projects, including the OLMo
series, TÜLU 3, and OLMo 2.^1^

The development of OLMES is motivated by a critical challenge within the
AI research community: the pervasive lack of consistency and
reproducibility in LLM evaluations.^2^ Progress in AI is frequently
measured by performance improvements on benchmark tasks, yet the
specific methods used to evaluate a given model on a task can
dramatically alter the resulting scores.^2^ Variations in prompt
formatting, the selection and presentation of few-shot examples
(in-context learning), techniques for normalizing model output
probabilities, and the fundamental way a task is presented to the model
(task formulation) contribute to this variability.^2^ Without a common,
agreed-upon standard, different research groups evaluate the same models
on the same tasks using disparate setups. This leads to conflicting
performance reports and hinders the ability to reliably reproduce
published findings or make fair comparisons between models.^2^ The
consequences are significant, potentially leading to inaccurate
conclusions about model capabilities and hindering scientific progress.

OLMES directly confronts this issue by proposing a comprehensive,
practical, and open standard for LLM evaluation.^2^ Its core design
philosophy centers around four key pillars:

1.  **Reproducibility:** OLMES aims to eliminate ambiguity by
    > meticulously specifying every detail of the evaluation process.
    > This includes dataset processing steps, precise prompt structures,
    > the exact few-shot examples used, normalization techniques
    > applied, and the method for interpreting model outputs to arrive
    > at a final metric.^3^

2.  **Practicality:** The standard is designed for real-world adoption.
    > It makes pragmatic choices regarding computational requirements
    > and complexity, facilitating integration into existing research
    > workflows.^3^

3.  **Documentation:** Every design decision within the OLMES standard
    > is explicitly documented and justified. These justifications draw
    > upon established findings in the LLM evaluation literature,
    > supplemented by new experiments conducted by the OLMES developers
    > to resolve open questions or validate specific choices.^2^

4.  **Openness:** AI2 has committed to transparency by releasing the
    > OLMES codebase, the curated prompts and few-shot examples, and the
    > detailed rationale behind the standard\'s design choices. This
    > allows the research community to adopt, verify, and build upon the
    > OLMES framework, extending its principles to new tasks and
    > models.^3^

The overarching goal of OLMES is to unify evaluation practices across
the field. By providing a robust, well-documented, and reproducible
standard, it facilitates more meaningful and reliable comparisons of
model performance. This applies not only to final, large-scale models
but also throughout the development lifecycle, enabling consistent
assessment from smaller base models (e.g., 1B parameters) to larger
instruction-tuned variants (e.g., 70B parameters) and across different
training stages.^3^

### B. Positioning within the LLM Evaluation Landscape (vs. lm-evaluation-harness) {#b.-positioning-within-the-llm-evaluation-landscape-vs.-lm-evaluation-harness}

OLMES is not built in isolation; it explicitly acknowledges its
foundation upon the widely used lm-evaluation-harness developed by
EleutherAI.^1^ Both frameworks share the common objective of providing
tools for standardized LLM evaluation, leveraging shared concepts and
often evaluating on similar benchmark tasks. However, OLMES introduces
several significant enhancements and modifications tailored to the
specific needs of rigorous, large-scale model development and analysis,
particularly as practiced at AI2.^1^

Key enhancements distinguishing OLMES include:

- **Deep, Python-based Configuration:** OLMES utilizes a sophisticated
  > configuration system based on Python dictionaries and code, allowing
  > for highly flexible and detailed specifications of task variants,
  > prompting strategies, and metric parameters.^1^ This contrasts with
  > potentially simpler declarative formats used elsewhere.

- **Granular Instance-Level Logging:** The framework is designed to
  > record detailed information about each individual prediction
  > instance, notably including the log probabilities assigned by the
  > model to different tokens or outputs.^1^ This enables fine-grained
  > analysis beyond aggregate scores.

- **Custom Metrics and Aggregation:** OLMES incorporates support for
  > defining and applying custom evaluation metrics and provides
  > flexible mechanisms for aggregating scores across tasks or sub-tasks
  > within a suite (e.g., macro averaging for MMLU).^1^

- **Diverse Storage Integrations:** Recognizing the need to manage
  > results from numerous experiments, OLMES integrates with various
  > external storage and tracking systems, including Google Sheets,
  > Hugging Face Hub datasets, remote file systems (like Amazon S3), and
  > Weights & Biases (W&B) projects.^1^

- **Standardized Task Formulation Handling:** A core contribution of
  > OLMES is its principled approach to handling different task
  > formulations, particularly for multiple-choice questions. It
  > explicitly supports both the Multiple Choice Formulation (MCF),
  > where the model chooses from labeled options, and the Cloze
  > Formulation (CF, also referred to as completion or generative
  > formulation), where the model generates the answer text directly.
  > OLMES often evaluates using both and selects the best score,
  > providing a mechanism to fairly compare smaller base models (which
  > may struggle with MCF prompts) against larger, more capable models
  > that excel with the MCF format.^2^

The development of these specific features appears driven by the
requirements of AI2\'s iterative model development process, exemplified
by the OLMo family.^1^ Reproducing subtle performance differences
between model checkpoints or architectures necessitates the granular
data captured by detailed logging (like log probabilities).^1^
Evaluating nuanced capabilities requires flexible and precisely
controlled task setups, enabled by the deep configuration system and the
careful handling of MCF/CF distinctions.^1^ Managing the large volume of
results generated across numerous experiments and model versions demands
robust integration with external storage and tracking platforms.^1^
While lm-evaluation-harness provides a solid foundation, it likely
lacked the depth in configuration management, detailed logging
capabilities, and seamless research ecosystem integration required for
AI2\'s specific workflow. Consequently, OLMES evolved into a more
comprehensive evaluation *system*, prioritizing depth of analysis,
configuration flexibility, and integration capabilities. This makes
OLMES exceptionally powerful for in-depth research and development but
potentially introduces a steeper learning curve compared to frameworks
focused on simpler, out-of-the-box evaluations.

## II. Anatomy of the OLMES Repository {#ii.-anatomy-of-the-olmes-repository}

### A. Codebase Organization: Top-Level Structure and the oe_eval Module {#a.-codebase-organization-top-level-structure-and-the-oe_eval-module}

The allenai/olmes repository follows a standard structure for Python
projects. At the root level, several key files define the project\'s
metadata, license, and usage instructions ^1^:

- .gitignore: Specifies files and directories intentionally excluded
  > from Git version control.

- LICENSE: Contains the Apache-2.0 license under which the OLMES
  > codebase is distributed.

- OUTPUT_FORMATS.md: A crucial documentation file describing the
  > structure and content of the output files generated during an
  > evaluation run.

- README.md: Provides an introduction to the project, setup
  > instructions, command-line usage examples, and links to relevant
  > papers and configurations.

- pyproject.toml: The standard configuration file for Python projects
  > using modern build systems like Poetry. It defines project metadata,
  > dependencies, and entry points.

The core logic of the evaluation framework resides within the oe_eval/
directory.^1^ While direct browsing of this directory\'s internal
structure was not fully successful based on available information ^12^,
its organization can be inferred from references in other files and the
described functionality:

- **oe_eval/configs/**: This subdirectory is central to the framework\'s
  > operation, housing the Python-based configuration files that define
  > models, tasks, and evaluation suites. Specific files like models.py,
  > tasks.py, and task_suites.py are explicitly mentioned.^1^

- **oe_eval/data/**: This directory likely contains helper modules or
  > definitions related to specific datasets or task families.
  > References in task_suites.py to modules like agi_eval_tasks,
  > bbh_tasks, and mmlu_subjects suggest this structure.^1^ It might
  > also house curated few-shot example data.

- **oe_eval/models/**: A plausible location for the code responsible for
  > loading, initializing, and interacting with the different model
  > backends (Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, LiteLLM) based on the
  > configuration.

- **oe_eval/tasks/**: This directory could contain task-specific logic,
  > such as specialized prompt formatting routines, instance processing
  > functions, or potentially implementations of task-specific metrics
  > not covered by standard libraries.

- **oe_eval/metrics/**: Likely contains implementations of custom
  > evaluation metrics and the logic for metric aggregation across
  > instances or tasks, as mentioned in the framework\'s features.^1^

- **oe_eval/launch.py**: Inferred as the main script executed when the
  > olmes command is invoked, based on the entry point definition olmes
  > = \"oe_eval.launch:main\" found in pyproject.toml.^15^

The organization suggests adherence to the principle of separation of
concerns, isolating configuration from core execution logic, data
handling, and model interaction. The use of specific, consistently named
files within the configs directory (e.g., models.py, tasks.py) points
towards a convention-based approach for discovering and loading
evaluation components. Large-scale evaluation efforts involving numerous
models and tasks benefit significantly from such an organized
structure.^1^ Placing configurations in dedicated, predictably named
files makes them easier to manage and extend. The core evaluation logic
can then dynamically load these configurations based on user requests,
simplifying the process of adding new models or tasks---often requiring
only additions to the relevant configuration file without altering the
main execution code. This convention-driven structure promotes
modularity and simplifies extending the framework, provided new
additions conform to the established patterns.

### B. Build and Dependency Management (pyproject.toml, Poetry) {#b.-build-and-dependency-management-pyproject.toml-poetry}

OLMES utilizes Poetry as its build system and dependency manager, as
indicated by the presence of the \[tool.poetry\] section within the
pyproject.toml file.^15^ Poetry handles the installation of
dependencies, package building, and virtual environment management,
aligning with modern Python development practices.^16^

The pyproject.toml file specifies the project\'s dependencies, which
form the foundation of the OLMES framework. Key runtime dependencies
include ^1^:

- **Core ML/NLP:** torch (version \>=2.2, \<2.5 recommended for vLLM
  > compatibility ^15^), transformers (for Hugging Face model and
  > tokenizer integration), datasets (for data loading), evaluate
  > (likely for standard metric implementations).

- **Performance/Efficiency:** accelerate (for distributed
  > training/inference utilities), vllm (optional, via \[gpu\] extra,
  > for optimized inference ^15^), bitsandbytes (for model quantization
  > ^15^), einops (required for specific model architectures like MPT
  > ^15^).

- **AI2 Ecosystem:** ai2-olmo (version \>=0.5.1 required for running
  > certain OLMo model variants ^15^).

- **Utilities & Integration:** protobuf, sentencepiece (common
  > tokenization/serialization), tensorboard (for logging), pygsheets
  > (for Google Sheets output integration ^15^), fsspec (pinned to
  > version 2023.5.0 to avoid specific dataset loading issues ^15^,
  > enabling interaction with various filesystems including remote ones
  > like S3), litellm (implied by \--model-type litellm support for API
  > models ^1^).

- **Development:** The \[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies\] section
  > (or \[project.optional-dependencies\].dev in standard
  > pyproject.toml) lists tools for code quality, testing, and
  > documentation, such as ruff, mypy, black, isort, and pytest.^15^

The following table summarizes key dependencies and their likely roles
within OLMES:

| **Dependency** | **Version/Constraint (Examples)** | **Role in OLMES**                                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| torch          | \>=2.2,\<2.5 ^15^                 | Core machine learning library (tensor operations)     |
| transformers   | \>=v4.37.1 (molmo) ^19^           | Hugging Face models, tokenizers, pipelines            |
| datasets       | \-                                | Loading and processing evaluation datasets            |
| evaluate       | \-                                | Standard evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1)      |
| vllm           | \>=0.6.2,\<0.6.4 ^15^             | Optimized LLM inference engine (GPU optional)         |
| litellm        | \-                                | Interface for API-based models (e.g., OpenAI)         |
| ai2-olmo       | \>=0.5.1 ^15^                     | Support for Allen AI\'s OLMo models                   |
| accelerate     | \-                                | Utilities for device placement, distributed exec.     |
| bitsandbytes   | \-                                | Model quantization (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit loading)       |
| pygsheets      | \-                                | Exporting results to Google Sheets                    |
| fsspec         | ==2023.5.0 ^15^                   | Filesystem abstraction (local, S3, HF Hub, etc.)      |
| wandb          | \-                                | Integration with Weights & Biases experiment tracking |
| poetry         | \-                                | Build system and dependency management                |

The dependency list reveals a clear alignment with the contemporary
Python machine learning ecosystem. The reliance on pyproject.toml and
Poetry reflects modern packaging standards. The core dependencies firmly
place OLMES within the PyTorch and Hugging Face spheres, leveraging
their extensive libraries for model handling, data loading, and basic
metrics. The inclusion of specialized libraries like vllm demonstrates a
focus on performance and scalability, crucial for evaluating
increasingly large models efficiently. Integration with AI2\'s own
ai2-olmo library is expected, enabling seamless evaluation of their
internally developed models. The careful pinning of fsspec ^15^ and the
torch version constraint related to vllm ^15^ highlight a potential
sensitivity to dependency updates, suggesting that maintaining a stable
environment requires attention to specific library versions. Overall,
the project is built upon a robust and widely adopted technological
foundation, enhancing its potential for integration with other modern ML
systems.

## III. The OLMES Configuration Engine {#iii.-the-olmes-configuration-engine}

### A. Design Principles: Python-based Deep Configuration {#a.-design-principles-python-based-deep-configuration}

A defining characteristic of OLMES is its approach to configuration
management. Instead of relying solely on declarative formats like YAML
or JSON(net) (which was used in its predecessor, OLMo-Eval ^23^), OLMES
primarily utilizes Python dictionaries, and potentially functions or
classes, defined directly within .py files located in the
oe_eval/configs/ directory.^1^ While the precise content of these files
is not fully visible from the provided materials ^13^, their structure
and usage patterns are evident from the command-line interface and
README descriptions.^1^

This shift towards Python-based configuration unlocks significant
flexibility and power.^1^ It allows developers to:

- **Embed Logic:** Directly embed Python logic within configuration
  > definitions, such as loops to generate configurations for numerous
  > related subtasks (e.g., iterating through MMLU subjects ^1^) or
  > conditional statements to set parameters based on other values.

- **Programmatic References:** Easily reference and reuse parts of other
  > configurations programmatically, promoting consistency and reducing
  > redundancy.

- **Complex Parameter Construction:** Construct complex configuration
  > values or structures using Python\'s full expressiveness, which
  > might be cumbersome or impossible in purely declarative formats.

This design choice reflects a trade-off. LLM evaluation often involves a
multitude of interacting parameters: model loading arguments, intricate
prompt formatting details, specific few-shot example selection
strategies, metric calculation options, and handling variations like MCF
vs. CF.^1^ Defining complex relationships and variations between these
parameters -- a common requirement in iterative research where many
slightly different evaluation setups are explored -- can become unwieldy
in declarative formats. Python\'s expressive power allows researchers to
capture these complex, interrelated configurations more effectively,
enabling the \"deep configurations\" highlighted as a key feature.^1^
However, this power comes at the cost of potential complexity.
Python-based configurations can be harder to read, write, and validate
for simple use cases compared to straightforward YAML or JSON files.
Fully leveraging this system requires a degree of Python proficiency
from the user.

### B. Configuring Models (oe_eval/configs/models.py) {#b.-configuring-models-oe_evalconfigsmodels.py}

Model configurations are centralized in the oe_eval/configs/models.py
file.^1^ Based on code snippets ^13^, these configurations are stored
within a dictionary, likely named MODEL_CONFIGS. Each model is
identified by a unique key, which can be used in the \--model CLI
argument (e.g., olmo-1b, olmoe-1b-7b-0924, dclm-7b).^1^

Each model\'s configuration entry is itself a dictionary containing
parameters that specify how the model should be loaded and handled. Key
parameters observed include ^1^:

- model: Specifies the primary identifier for the model, typically its
  > path on the Hugging Face Hub (e.g., \"allenai/OLMoE-1B-7B-0924\",
  > \"apple/DCLM-7B\").

- model_path: An optional list that can include local filesystem paths
  > or alternative remote paths (e.g., s3://, hf://) for locating model
  > weights.

- max_length: Allows overriding the default maximum sequence length
  > (context size) for the model.

- chat_model: A boolean flag (True/False) indicating whether the model
  > is a chat or instruction-tuned model, which may influence prompting
  > or processing.

- metadata: A nested dictionary for storing supplementary information,
  > such as the model_size if not apparent from the key.

- gantry_args: Appears to hold configuration specific to Allen AI\'s
  > internal execution or deployment systems (e.g., installation
  > commands required in that environment).

The framework supports different model execution backends, selectable
via the \--model-type CLI flag.^1^ While the default uses standard
Hugging Face transformers implementations, users can specify vllm to
leverage the VLLM engine for optimized inference (especially for larger
models) or litellm to evaluate models accessed via APIs. The model
configuration dictionary likely interacts with the selected backend to
ensure the model is loaded correctly.

### C. Configuring Tasks (oe_eval/configs/tasks.py) {#c.-configuring-tasks-oe_evalconfigstasks.py}

Evaluation tasks are defined in oe_eval/configs/tasks.py.^1^ Similar to
models, tasks are represented as entries in a central dictionary. The
keys for these entries often follow a structured format like
\<task_name\>:\<formulation_type\>::\<config_version\> (e.g.,
\"arc_challenge:rc::olmes\", \"mmlu_anatomy:mc::olmes\"), clearly
identifying the base task, the specific way it\'s presented to the
model, and the configuration standard being used.^1^

Each task configuration dictionary contains parameters detailing how the
evaluation for that specific task variant should be performed. Based on
examples and documentation, common parameters include ^1^:

- task_name: The identifier for the underlying dataset or benchmark
  > (e.g., \"arc_challenge\", \"hellaswag\").

- split: The dataset split to use for evaluation (e.g., \"test\",
  > \"validation\", \"dev\"). OLMES standard often uses \"test\" if
  > labels are available, otherwise \"validation\".^26^

- primary_metric: Specifies the main metric to be reported as the
  > primary score for this task (e.g., \"acc_uncond\", which might
  > represent accuracy under a specific normalization or formulation).

- num_shots: The number of few-shot examples to include in the prompt
  > (e.g., 5). The OLMES standard frequently employs curated 5-shot
  > examples.^4^

- fewshot_source: An identifier pointing to the specific set of few-shot
  > examples to be used, ensuring consistency (e.g.,
  > \"OLMES:ARC-Challenge\").

- metadata: A dictionary for additional metadata, such as tracking the
  > evaluation regime or version (e.g., {\"regimes\":}).

- context_kwargs: Parameters controlling the details of prompt
  > formatting, including prefixes (e.g., \"Question:\"), suffixes
  > (e.g., \"Answer:\"), and potentially task-specific instructions or
  > formatting rules.^6^

- generation_kwargs: Parameters controlling the model\'s text generation
  > process (e.g., max_new_tokens, temperature, top_p).

- metric_kwargs: Parameters passed to the metric calculation functions,
  > potentially enabling different modes or variations of a metric.

A crucial aspect of OLMES task configuration is the explicit handling of
Multiple Choice Formulation (MCF) versus Cloze Formulation (CF). The
framework often defines distinct configurations for each formulation of
a multiple-choice task, identifiable by the formulation type in the key
(e.g., :mc:: vs. :rc:: or :cf::). The OLMES standard evaluation protocol
may involve running both formulations and reporting the maximum score
achieved.^1^ This dual approach acknowledges that CF, which treats the
task as predicting the most likely continuation, can be a more effective
way to evaluate the knowledge of smaller base models that may not
robustly follow the instructions implicit in an MCF prompt. Conversely,
MCF provides a more direct and often more challenging assessment for
larger, more capable models that can understand and respond to the
explicit choice format.^6^

### D. Defining Task Suites (oe_eval/configs/task_suites.py) {#d.-defining-task-suites-oe_evalconfigstask_suites.py}

To facilitate running groups of related tasks together, OLMES uses task
suites defined in oe_eval/configs/task_suites.py.^1^ These suites are
also defined as entries in a dictionary, likely named TASK_SUITE_CONFIGS
based on usage examples.^1^ Suite keys can be passed to the \--task CLI
argument just like individual task keys.

The configuration for a task suite typically includes ^1^:

- tasks: A list containing the keys of the individual task
  > configurations that belong to this suite. This list can be defined
  > statically or generated programmatically using Python list
  > comprehensions, as shown in the MMLU example (\`\`).

- primary_metric: Specifies how the scores from the individual tasks
  > within the suite should be aggregated to produce an overall suite
  > score. Common aggregation methods include macro averaging (simple
  > average of task scores) or potentially weighted averages.

The repository includes predefined suites corresponding to specific
evaluation sets used in AI2 research papers, such as core_9mcqa::olmes
(the original 9 OLMES MC tasks excluding MMLU), mmlu::olmes (the full
MMLU suite), main_suite::olmo1 (evals for the original OLMo), and suites
related to TÜLU 3 development (tulu_3_dev) and final evaluation
(tulu_3_unseen).^1^ These suites provide convenient shortcuts for
running standard evaluation protocols.

### E. Runtime Configuration via CLI Overrides {#e.-runtime-configuration-via-cli-overrides}

While the Python configuration files define the standard and reusable
evaluation setups, OLMES provides flexibility for experimentation and
specific runs through command-line overrides.^1^ This layered approach
allows users to modify parameters without permanently altering the
version-controlled configuration files.

Key override mechanisms include:

- **Model Arguments (\--model-args):** This flag accepts a JSON string
  > containing arbitrary keyword arguments that are passed directly to
  > the underlying model loading function (e.g., Hugging Face
  > from_pretrained). This is useful for controlling settings like
  > trust_remote_code=True, add_bos_token=True, or specifying
  > quantization configurations.^1^

- **Global Task Parameter Overrides:** Certain flags can override
  > specific parameters for *all* tasks being run in a single
  > invocation. For example, \--split dev might force all tasks to use
  > their development split instead of the default specified in their
  > configs.^1^ Similarly, one could potentially override num_shots
  > globally.

- **Task-Specific Overrides:** For more granular control, users can
  > provide overrides for specific tasks using a JSON format directly
  > within the \--task argument list. For instance, one could specify
  > olmes \--task \'{\"task_name\": \"arc_challenge:rc::olmes\",
  > \"num_shots\": 2}\' \'{\"task_name\": \"hellaswag:rc::olmes\",
  > \"num_shots\": 4}\'\... to run ARC with 2 shots and Hellaswag with 4
  > shots, overriding their default configurations.^1^

This layered configuration strategy balances the need for
standardization and reproducibility (captured in the base .py config
files) with the practical requirement for flexibility in research and
experimentation (enabled by CLI overrides). Researchers can rely on the
stable, version-controlled base configurations for standard reporting
while easily tweaking parameters for specific ablation studies or
exploratory runs using the command line.

## IV. Executing Evaluations: The Pipeline from CLI to Metrics {#iv.-executing-evaluations-the-pipeline-from-cli-to-metrics}

### A. The olmes Command-Line Interface: Usage and Capabilities {#a.-the-olmes-command-line-interface-usage-and-capabilities}

The primary user interface for the OLMES framework is the olmes
command-line tool. This tool is registered as a script entry point in
the pyproject.toml file, mapping the command olmes to the main function
within the oe_eval.launch module.^15^ Invoking olmes initiates the
evaluation pipeline.

The core command structure follows the pattern:

olmes \--model \<model_identifier\> \--task \<task_or_suite_identifier\>
\--output-dir \<directory_path\>.1

This basic command specifies the model to evaluate, the task(s) or
suite(s) to run, and the location where output files should be saved.
Beyond this core usage, the CLI offers a range of flags and options to
control the evaluation process ^1^:

- **Model Specification:**

  - \--model \<id\>: Identifies the model using a Hugging Face path
    > (e.g., google/gemma-2b) or a key defined in
    > oe_eval/configs/models.py (e.g., olmo-1b).^1^

  - \--model-type \<type\>: Selects the backend: hf (Hugging Face
    > Transformers, default), vllm (VLLM engine), or litellm (API-based
    > models).^1^

  - \--model-args \'\<json_string\>\': Passes additional arguments as a
    > JSON string directly to the model loading function.^1^

- **Task Specification:**

  - \--task \<id\> \[\<id\>\...\]: Specifies one or more task keys or
    > task suite keys from the configuration files.^1^

- **Output and Storage:**

  - \--output-dir \<path\>: Mandatory argument specifying the local
    > directory for results.^1^

  - \--hf-save-dir \<path\>: Optionally saves results in Hugging Face
    > dataset format.^1^

  - \--remote-output-dir \<uri\>: Optionally saves results to a remote
    > location (e.g., s3://\...).^1^

  - \--wandb-run-path \<path\>: Optionally logs results to a specified
    > W&B run.^1^

  - \--gsheet \<name\>: Optionally uploads results to a Google Sheet.^1^

- **Execution Control & Inspection:**

  - \--inspect: Performs a sanity check by showing a sample prompt for
    > the specified task and running a very small evaluation (e.g., 5
    > instances).^1^

  - \--dry-run: Prints the fully expanded command and configuration
    > details without actually executing the evaluation.^1^

  - \--list-models \[\<regex\>\]: Lists available model configuration
    > keys, optionally filtering by a regular expression.^1^

  - \--list-tasks \[\<regex\>\]: Lists available task and suite
    > configuration keys, optionally filtering by a regular
    > expression.^1^

- **Configuration Overrides:**

  - \--split \<name\>: Overrides the dataset split for all tasks.^1^

  - Task-specific JSON overrides within the \--task list (see Section
    > III.E).^1^

- **Help:**

  - \--help: Displays the full list of available command-line arguments
    > and their descriptions.^1^

The following table provides a quick reference for some of the most
important olmes CLI arguments:

| **Argument**      | **Description**                                                   | **Example Usage**                                                          |

### B. Internal Workflow Stages (Inferred) {#b.-internal-workflow-stages-inferred}

Based on the CLI, configuration structure, dependencies, and output
formats, the internal workflow of the olmes command likely proceeds
through the following stages:

1.  **Initialization:** The oe_eval.launch:main function is called. It
    > parses the command-line arguments provided by the user. Project
    > settings might be loaded from pyproject.toml.

2.  **Configuration Loading and Resolution:** Based on the \--model and
    > \--task arguments, the corresponding configurations are loaded
    > from the Python dictionaries within oe_eval/configs/. If a task
    > suite key is provided, the list of associated tasks is resolved.
    > Any CLI overrides (\--model-args, \--split, task-specific JSON)
    > are applied, modifying the loaded configurations for this specific
    > run.

3.  **Model Loading:** The appropriate model backend (hf, vllm, litellm)
    > is invoked based on \--model-type. The model specified by the
    > resolved configuration (including model identifier and any
    > \--model-args) is loaded into memory. Device placement (CPU/GPU)
    > is handled, potentially utilizing accelerate for managing
    > resources across multiple devices if configured.

4.  **Task Iteration:** The system iterates through the final list of
    > task configurations determined in step 2.

5.  **Data Loading and Preparation (Per Task):** For the current task,
    > the relevant dataset is loaded, likely using the datasets library.
    > Preprocessing steps defined in the task configuration are applied.
    > If the dataset is larger than a specified limit (e.g., 1500
    > instances for the OLMES standard ^26^), instance sampling occurs
    > (e.g., down to 1000 instances ^26^). Prompts are constructed
    > according to the task\'s configuration (context_kwargs, num_shots,
    > selected fewshot_source examples, MCF/CF formatting rules).

6.  **Inference (Per Task):** The prepared prompts are passed to the
    > loaded model for inference. Input data is likely batched for
    > efficiency (potentially controlled by arguments similar to
    > \--max-batch-tokens seen in OLMo-Eval ^26^). The model\'s outputs
    > (e.g., generated text sequences, log probabilities over the
    > vocabulary) are collected. Raw request details (the exact input
    > sent to the model) are logged, likely forming the
    > task-XXX-requests.jsonl file.^28^

7.  **Prediction Processing and Metrics (Per Task):** Model outputs are
    > processed based on the task requirements (e.g., extracting the
    > chosen option in MCF, normalizing probabilities in CF).
    > Instance-level predictions and scores are calculated. These are
    > aggregated according to the metrics specified in the task
    > configuration (primary_metric, metric_kwargs). Instance-level
    > prediction details are logged (likely to
    > task-XXX-predictions.jsonl), aggregate metrics are saved (to
    > task-XXX-metrics.json), and a small sample of formatted inputs
    > might be recorded (to task-XXX-recorded-inputs.jsonl).^28^

8.  **Aggregation and Final Output:** Once all tasks in the iteration
    > are complete, if any task suites were run, their overall scores
    > are calculated based on the specified aggregation method
    > (primary_metric in the suite config). Final summary files are
    > generated: metrics.json (a simplified view for experiment tracking
    > platforms) and metrics-all.jsonl (a concatenation of all
    > individual task metric files).^28^

9.  **External Storage Upload:** If any external storage options
    > (\--gsheet, \--hf-save-dir, \--remote-output-dir,
    > \--wandb-run-path) were specified, the relevant output files are
    > uploaded to those destinations.

While this workflow follows a logical progression common to many
evaluation frameworks (configure -\> load model -\> load data -\> prompt
-\> infer -\> calculate metrics -\> report), OLMES distinguishes itself
through the specific implementations at each stage. The Python-based
configuration engine enables complex setups (Step 2). Support for
multiple backends provides versatility (Step 3). Sophisticated prompting
logic handles few-shot examples and MCF/CF variations (Step 5). Detailed
logging captures granular data for analysis (Steps 6, 7). Finally,
integrated storage options streamline results management within a
research context (Step 9). The value of OLMES lies not just in executing
evaluations, but in the reproducibility, flexibility, and analytical
depth afforded by these specialized components.

### C. Support for Diverse Model Backends (Hugging Face, vLLM, LiteLLM) {#c.-support-for-diverse-model-backends-hugging-face-vllm-litellm}

A key aspect of OLMES\'s flexibility is its support for multiple model
execution backends, controlled by the \--model-type argument.^1^ This
allows users to evaluate a wide range of models within a single
framework:

- **Hugging Face (hf, default):** This backend leverages the standard
  > Hugging Face transformers library. It likely uses
  > AutoModelForCausalLM and associated classes to load and run models
  > available on the Hub or locally, assuming they are compatible with
  > the library. This is the baseline for evaluating most publicly
  > available open models.

- **vLLM (vllm):** This option integrates the vLLM library, an engine
  > specifically designed for highly optimized LLM inference on GPUs.
  > Using \--model-type vllm (which requires installing dependencies via
  > pip install.\[gpu\] ^15^) can significantly accelerate the
  > evaluation process, especially for large models where inference time
  > is a major bottleneck. The OLMoE model, for example, explicitly
  > mentions integration with vLLM.^29^

- **LiteLLM (litellm):** This backend enables the evaluation of models
  > accessed via APIs, such as those provided by OpenAI, Anthropic,
  > Google, and others. LiteLLM acts as a standardized interface to
  > these various APIs. This allows researchers using OLMES to benchmark
  > their models against state-of-the-art proprietary models, providing
  > crucial context for performance assessment. However, there may be
  > limitations; for instance, likelihood-based calculations (relying on
  > log probabilities) might not be universally implemented or available
  > for all API models accessed through this backend.^30^

This multi-backend support reflects a pragmatic approach to the modern
LLM ecosystem. Research and development often involve working with
different types of models: internally developed open models (best
handled by hf or vllm), large open models requiring performance
optimization (vllm), and closed-source API models used for comparison
(litellm). By accommodating these diverse scenarios, OLMES provides a
versatile and practical tool for comprehensive evaluation. It allows
users to employ the most appropriate execution method for each model
while maintaining a consistent evaluation setup and reporting structure
across all of them, although minor differences in available metrics or
capabilities might exist between backends.

## V. Data Flow: Inputs, Outputs, and Storage {#v.-data-flow-inputs-outputs-and-storage}

### A. Dataset Integration and Few-Shot Prompting {#a.-dataset-integration-and-few-shot-prompting}

The OLMES framework seamlessly integrates with standard dataset formats
and incorporates sophisticated prompting techniques. Dataset loading
likely relies heavily on the Hugging Face datasets library, a core
dependency, allowing access to a vast range of benchmarks available on
the Hub. The inclusion of fsspec as a dependency also suggests the
capability to load data from various local and remote sources.^15^

A critical component of the input data flow is the handling of few-shot
examples for in-context learning. Task configurations explicitly control
this via the num_shots and fewshot_source parameters.^1^ The num_shots
parameter dictates how many examples are included in the prompt
preceding the actual test instance. The fewshot_source parameter points
to a specific, curated set of examples, ensuring that the same
high-quality, representative examples are used consistently across
different runs of the same task configuration. The OLMES standard places
particular emphasis on this, often utilizing manually curated 5-shot
prompts derived from the task\'s training set. These curated examples
aim to be balanced across the label space and are considered a core part
of the standardized evaluation setup.^4^ These curated sets might be
stored directly within the codebase, potentially in files like
std_fewshots.py (as was done in the earlier OLMo-Eval system ^26^).
Analysis supporting the OLMES standard suggests that using more than 5
shots often yields diminishing returns in score improvements.^6^

Prompt formatting is meticulously controlled via parameters like
context_kwargs in the task configuration.^1^ This includes defining
consistent prefixes (e.g., \"Question:\", \"Q:\") and suffixes (e.g.,
\"Answer:\", \"A:\") or answer choice formatting (e.g., \"A.\", \"(A)\")
to structure the input clearly for the model.^6^ OLMES configurations
also implement task-specific formatting adjustments, such as adding
unique instructions (\"Choose the best continuation:\") or removing
prefixes/suffixes entirely for certain tasks and formulations (e.g.,
specific setups for PIQA, HELLASWAG, WINOGRANDE).^6^ This careful
control over dataset loading, few-shot example selection, and prompt
formatting is essential for achieving the framework\'s goal of
reproducible and standardized evaluations.

### B. Standard Output File Formats (OUTPUT_FORMATS.md) {#b.-standard-output-file-formats-output_formats.md}

OLMES generates a structured set of output files for each evaluation
run, detailed in the OUTPUT_FORMATS.md document.^1^ This standardized
output facilitates parsing, analysis, and comparison of results. The
outputs are generated in the directory specified by the \--output-dir
argument.

For *each individual task* executed within a run (e.g., the first task,
index 0, being arc_challenge), the following files are typically
produced ^28^:

- task-000-arc_challenge-metrics.json: Contains the summary metrics
  > calculated for this specific task (e.g., accuracy, F1 score).
  > Crucially, this file also includes the full configuration details
  > for both the model and the task variant used in this run, ensuring
  > traceability. Format: JSON. Generation Time: Typically after the
  > task completes, unless metric calculation is deferred (e.g., for
  > aggregated metrics).

- task-000-arc_challenge-predictions.jsonl: Stores detailed information
  > about the model\'s prediction for each instance evaluated in the
  > task. This includes the processed prediction, ground truth labels,
  > and potentially instance-level scores or log probabilities. Format:
  > JSON Lines (JSONL), with each line representing one instance.
  > Generation Time: Per-task.

- task-000-arc_challenge-requests.jsonl: Logs the exact input prompts
  > that were sent to the model for each instance. This is invaluable
  > for debugging and understanding precisely how the task was presented
  > to the model. Format: JSON Lines (JSONL). Generation Time: Per-task.

- task-000-arc_challenge-recorded-inputs.jsonl: Contains a small sample
  > (e.g., 3 instances as mentioned for OLMo-Eval ^26^) of the formatted
  > inputs, intended for quick visual inspection and sanity checking of
  > the prompting logic. Format: JSON Lines (JSONL). Generation Time:
  > Per-task.

After *all tasks* in the evaluation run have completed, two additional
summary files are generated ^28^:

- metrics.json: Provides a consolidated, simplified view of the primary
  > metrics for all tasks executed. This format is often designed for
  > easy ingestion by experiment tracking platforms or dashboards (like
  > Beaker, mentioned in relation to the output format ^28^). Format:
  > JSON. Generation Time: End-of-run.

- metrics-all.jsonl: A concatenation of all the individual
  > task-\<nnn\>-\<taskname\>-metrics.json files into a single JSON
  > Lines file. This provides a complete record of all detailed metrics
  > and configurations for every task run. Format: JSON Lines (JSONL).
  > Generation Time: End-of-run.

The following table summarizes these standard output files:

| **Filename Pattern**                            | **Content Description**                                                       | **Format** | **Generation Time** |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|---------------------|
| task-\<nnn\>-\<taskname\>-metrics.json          | Aggregate metrics for the task, including full model/task configuration       | JSON       | Per-Task            |
| task-\<nnn\>-\<taskname\>-predictions.jsonl     | Instance-level predictions, ground truth, potentially scores/logprobs         | JSONL      | Per-Task            |
| task-\<nnn\>-\<taskname\>-requests.jsonl        | Instance-level raw input prompts sent to the model                            | JSONL      | Per-Task            |
| task-\<nnn\>-\<taskname\>-recorded-inputs.jsonl | Small sample of formatted model inputs for sanity checks                      | JSONL      | Per-Task            |
| metrics.json                                    | Simplified summary of primary metrics across all tasks (for platform display) | JSON       | End-of-Run          |
| metrics-all.jsonl                               | Concatenation of all individual task metrics files (complete detailed record) | JSONL      | End-of-Run          |

This structured and comprehensive output logging is fundamental to
OLMES\'s goal of reproducibility and deep analysis. It provides users
with not only the final scores but also the intermediate data
(predictions, requests) and configurations needed to understand, verify,
and potentially debug the evaluation results.

### C. Granularity: Capturing Instance-Level Details (Logprobs) {#c.-granularity-capturing-instance-level-details-logprobs}

A key feature distinguishing OLMES is its emphasis on recording
detailed, instance-level information, explicitly including
model-assigned log probabilities.^1^ This granular data is typically
stored within the task-XXX-predictions.jsonl file alongside the
processed predictions and ground truth labels for each instance
evaluated.

Capturing log probabilities offers significant advantages over
frameworks that only report final predictions or aggregate scores:

- **Deeper Analysis:** Logprobs provide insight into the model\'s
  > confidence in its predictions. Analyzing the probability assigned to
  > the correct versus incorrect answers can reveal issues related to
  > model calibration or uncertainty estimation.

- **Failure Mode Investigation:** By examining instances where the model
  > was incorrect but assigned high probability, or correct but assigned
  > low probability, researchers can gain a better understanding of
  > specific model weaknesses or edge cases in the data.

- **Support for Complex Metrics:** Certain evaluation metrics inherently
  > require probability information. For example, perplexity is
  > calculated directly from log probabilities, and some normalization
  > techniques for multiple-choice questions (like PMI normalization
  > mentioned in OLMES context ^4^) rely on comparing the probabilities
  > of different answer choices.

- **Reproducibility:** Storing the underlying probabilities allows for
  > exact recalculation of metrics and verification of results, further
  > enhancing reproducibility.

This commitment to capturing fine-grained, instance-level data,
including log probabilities, underscores OLMES\'s design as a system
intended for rigorous scientific investigation and detailed model
understanding, going beyond simple leaderboard rankings.

### D. External Storage Options {#d.-external-storage-options}

Recognizing that large-scale evaluation efforts generate substantial
amounts of data that need to be managed, shared, and tracked over time,
OLMES incorporates integrations with several external storage and
experiment tracking platforms.^1^ These options provide alternatives or
additions to saving results solely to the local filesystem via
\--output-dir.

Supported external storage options include:

- **Google Sheets (\--gsheet):** Allows uploading evaluation metrics to
  > a specified Google Sheet. This provides a simple, collaborative way
  > to view and share high-level results, particularly useful for quick
  > summaries or tracking progress across runs.^1^ Authentication is
  > typically handled via environment variables
  > (GDRIVE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON).^1^

- **Hugging Face Hub Datasets (\--hf-save-dir):** Enables saving the
  > evaluation outputs in the Hugging Face datasets format to a
  > specified directory, which can then be easily pushed to the Hub.
  > This facilitates public sharing of detailed results and allows
  > others to load and analyze the outputs using the datasets
  > library.^1^

- **Remote Directories (\--remote-output-dir):** Supports saving output
  > files to remote storage locations, such as cloud buckets (e.g.,
  > Amazon S3). This leverages the fsspec library for interacting with
  > various remote filesystems and is suitable for handling large
  > volumes of output data in a scalable manner.^1^

- **Weights & Biases (\--wandb-run-path):** Integrates with the popular
  > W&B platform for experiment tracking. Specifying a run path allows
  > OLMES to log metrics and potentially configuration details directly
  > to an existing or new W&B run, linking evaluation results with model
  > training or other experimental parameters tracked in W&B.^1^

The inclusion of these diverse storage options highlights that OLMES is
designed with the practicalities of research workflows in mind. Running
evaluations is only one part of the process; effectively managing,
analyzing, comparing, and sharing the resulting data is equally
important, especially in collaborative or long-term research projects.
These integrations position OLMES not just as an evaluation runner, but
as a component within a larger MLOps or research infrastructure
ecosystem.

## VI. Architectural Patterns and Best Practices {#vi.-architectural-patterns-and-best-practices}

The design and implementation of the OLMES repository showcase several
architectural patterns and best practices aimed at achieving its goals
of reproducibility, flexibility, and extensibility.

### A. Modularity and Separation of Concerns {#a.-modularity-and-separation-of-concerns}

The codebase exhibits a clear separation of distinct functional areas.
Configuration logic is isolated within the oe_eval/configs/ directory.
The command-line interface is handled by the entry point script (olmes,
likely invoking oe_eval/launch.py). Core evaluation workflow logic,
model interaction (potentially delegated to specific backends like HF,
vLLM, LiteLLM), data processing, and metric calculation are likely
organized into distinct modules within oe_eval/. This modular design
enhances maintainability, as changes in one area (e.g., adding a new
model backend) are less likely to impact others (e.g., task
configuration). It also improves testability, allowing individual
components to be tested more easily in isolation. Furthermore, it lays
the groundwork for extensibility, as new functionalities can often be
added by creating new modules or extending existing ones without
requiring wholesale changes to the system architecture.

### B. Strategies for Ensuring Reproducibility {#b.-strategies-for-ensuring-reproducibility}

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of OLMES, and several mechanisms work
together to achieve this:

- **Versioned Configurations:** The practice of including version
  > identifiers or regime names within task configuration keys (e.g.,
  > ::olmes, ::tulu3) provides an explicit way to track and reference
  > specific, standardized evaluation setups.^1^ This ensures that
  > running arc_challenge::olmes today yields the same setup as when the
  > standard was defined.

- **Comprehensive Logging:** OLMES logs extensive information about each
  > run. The output files capture not only the final metrics but also
  > the full model and task configurations used (task-XXX-metrics.json),
  > the exact prompts sent to the model (task-XXX-requests.jsonl), and
  > detailed instance-level predictions including log probabilities
  > (task-XXX-predictions.jsonl).^1^ This wealth of data allows for
  > precise reconstruction of the evaluation process and aids in
  > debugging discrepancies.

- **Standardized Prompting Artifacts:** The use of fixed, curated
  > few-shot example sets identified by fewshot_source eliminates
  > variability that could arise from random sampling of examples during
  > prompt construction.^1^ Consistent prompt formatting rules further
  > reduce ambiguity.

- **Explicit Task Formulation Handling:** The documented and systematic
  > approach to using both MCF and CF formulations provides a clear
  > standard for comparing models with different capabilities, avoiding
  > inconsistent choices made ad-hoc by different researchers.^2^

- **Robust Dependency Management:** Employing Poetry ensures that the
  > exact versions of all dependencies are captured (implicitly in
  > poetry.lock), allowing others to recreate the precise software
  > environment used for a specific evaluation run, minimizing
  > variations caused by differing library versions.

### C. Achieving Flexibility through Configuration {#c.-achieving-flexibility-through-configuration}

Flexibility is achieved primarily through the sophisticated
configuration system:

- **Python-based Deep Configurations:** As discussed previously, using
  > Python code for configuration allows for unparalleled flexibility in
  > defining complex task variants, parameter relationships, and
  > programmatic generation of evaluation setups.^1^

- **Command-Line Overrides:** The ability to override configuration
  > parameters via CLI flags provides runtime customization for
  > experiments without needing to modify the underlying,
  > version-controlled configuration files.^1^

- **Multiple Model Backends:** Support for standard Hugging Face models,
  > optimized inference via vLLM, and API-based models via LiteLLM
  > caters to the diverse landscape of LLMs and deployment scenarios
  > encountered in research.^1^

- **Custom Metrics and Aggregation:** The framework allows users to
  > define and integrate their own metrics and specify how results
  > should be aggregated across tasks or suites, enabling evaluation
  > tailored to specific research questions beyond standard
  > benchmarks.^1^

### D. Extensibility Points (Adding Models, Tasks, Metrics) {#d.-extensibility-points-adding-models-tasks-metrics}

The architecture appears designed for extensibility, primarily driven by
its convention-based configuration system:

- **Adding Models:** Supporting a new model that uses an existing
  > backend (like Hugging Face) likely only requires adding a new
  > configuration entry to the MODEL_CONFIGS dictionary in
  > oe_eval/configs/models.py, specifying its identifier, path, and any
  > necessary parameters.^13^ Adding support for a fundamentally new
  > *type* of model or backend would require more significant code
  > changes in the model loading and interaction logic.

- **Adding Tasks:** Integrating a new evaluation task typically
  > involves:

  1.  Adding one or more configuration entries to
      > oe_eval/configs/tasks.py defining the task name, data source,
      > splits, prompting parameters (num_shots, fewshot_source,
      > context_kwargs), metrics, etc..^1^

  2.  Ensuring the dataset is accessible (e.g., available via the
      > datasets library).

  3.  Potentially adding task-specific data processing or prompt
      > formatting logic if the standard mechanisms are insufficient.

  4.  Curating and potentially adding new few-shot example sets if
      > required.

- **Adding Metrics:** Introducing a new metric likely involves
  > implementing the metric calculation function (possibly within an
  > oe_eval/metrics/ module) and then referencing this metric
  > function\'s identifier within the primary_metric or metric_kwargs
  > fields of relevant task configurations.

This convention-driven approach, where the framework discovers and
utilizes components based on entries in configuration files, makes
common extensions relatively straightforward. The system is designed to
be extended primarily by adding new configuration data that follows
established patterns, rather than requiring extensive modifications to
the core execution logic for every new model or standard task. Adding
fundamentally new capabilities (e.g., a new type of task formulation or
a novel metric requiring complex state) might naturally necessitate
deeper code integration.

## VII. Actionable Insights and Integration Strategy {#vii.-actionable-insights-and-integration-strategy}

This deep analysis of the OLMES repository provides several actionable
takeaways and strategic considerations for teams looking to leverage,
adapt, or learn from this framework.

### A. Key Architectural Takeaways for Your Team {#a.-key-architectural-takeaways-for-your-team}

- **Configuration Power:** The use of Python for deep configuration
  > offers immense flexibility for complex evaluation scenarios where
  > parameters are interdependent or require programmatic generation.
  > This pattern is valuable when simple declarative formats become
  > limiting.

- **Structured Outputs:** The well-defined, multi-file output structure
  > (metrics, predictions, requests, samples) using standard formats
  > (JSON, JSONL) is crucial for reproducibility, debugging, and
  > downstream analysis. Capturing full configurations within metric
  > files is a key practice for traceability.

- **Backend Versatility:** Supporting multiple model execution backends
  > (standard HF, optimized local inference like vLLM, external APIs via
  > LiteLLM) within a single framework is essential for comprehensive
  > benchmarking in the current LLM ecosystem.

- **Evaluation Versioning:** Explicitly versioning evaluation
  > configurations (e.g., using suffixes like ::olmes in task keys) is
  > vital for ensuring that comparisons over time or across different
  > studies are based on the exact same setup.

- **Workflow Integration:** Building in support for external storage
  > (cloud buckets, HF Hub) and experiment tracking platforms (W&B,
  > Google Sheets) significantly enhances the usability of an evaluation
  > framework within a research or MLOps workflow.

### B. Reusable Concepts and Patterns for Your Evaluation Package {#b.-reusable-concepts-and-patterns-for-your-evaluation-package}

Teams developing their own evaluation packages can draw inspiration from
several OLMES patterns:

- **Layered Configuration:** Consider adopting a layered approach where
  > base, version-controlled configurations define standards, while
  > command-line arguments or separate configuration files allow for
  > temporary overrides during experimentation. Evaluate whether the
  > complexity of Python-based configuration is necessary or if a
  > structured declarative format (like YAML with includes/anchors, or
  > JSONnet) offers a better balance for your needs.

- **Standardized Output Schema:** Define a clear, consistent schema for
  > output files, potentially mirroring the OLMES structure
  > (metrics.json, predictions.jsonl, requests.jsonl). Using JSON/JSONL

- **Granular Logging:** If detailed analysis of model behavior is a
  > requirement, implement logging of instance-level information,
  > including the exact prompts used, model outputs, and ideally log
  > probabilities.

- **MCF/CF Strategy:** If evaluating a mix of base and instruction-tuned
  > models on multiple-choice tasks, develop a principled strategy for
  > handling both Multiple Choice and Cloze formulations, potentially
  > adopting the OLMES approach of evaluating both and reporting the
  > maximum score.

- **CLI Ergonomics:** Incorporate user-friendly CLI features inspired by
  > olmes, such as commands to list available models/tasks (\--list-\*),
  > options for quick inspection (\--inspect), dry runs (\--dry-run),
  > and clear mechanisms for parameter overrides.

### C. Considerations for Adapting OLMES Components {#c.-considerations-for-adapting-olmes-components}

Directly integrating or adapting parts of the OLMES codebase requires
careful consideration:

- **Complexity vs. Need:** The Python configuration system is powerful
  > but adds complexity. Assess if this level of flexibility is truly
  > required for your use cases or if a simpler system would be more
  > maintainable.

- **Dependency Compatibility:** Thoroughly review OLMES\'s dependencies
  > (pyproject.toml) ^15^ and their specific versions. Ensure
  > compatibility with your existing environment and be prepared to
  > manage potential conflicts or specific version requirements (e.g.,
  > for torch and vllm). Integrating optional components like vllm may
  > impose hardware (GPU) and specific CUDA version constraints.

- **Integration Depth:** Decide on the level of integration. Simply
  > running OLMES as a separate tool is the easiest path. Directly
  > reusing code modules from oe_eval (e.g., specific task
  > implementations, metric functions, prompting logic) will likely
  > require adopting or adapting OLMES\'s internal data structures and
  > configuration paradigms. Forking and modifying the entire repository
  > offers maximum control but incurs a maintenance burden.

- **Task and Model Focus:** OLMES is heavily influenced by the
  > evaluation needs of AI2\'s research, particularly around the OLMo
  > models and associated benchmarks.^1^ Ensure that the tasks and
  > models readily supported by OLMES align with your team\'s primary
  > evaluation targets. Extending it to significantly different task
  > types might require substantial effort.

### D. Structuring Knowledge for Potential AI Agent Interpretation {#d.-structuring-knowledge-for-potential-ai-agent-interpretation}

To make the understanding of OLMES accessible to an AI agent, the
information should be presented with clear structure and explicit
relationships:

- **Logical Flow:** Organize the information hierarchically, following
  > the report\'s structure: start with the high-level purpose and
  > problem statement, delve into repository structure, configuration
  > mechanisms, execution workflow, data flow, architectural patterns,
  > and conclude with actionable takeaways.

- **Explicit Definitions:** Clearly define key terms and concepts upon
  > first use (e.g., OLMES, lm-evaluation-harness, MCF, CF,
  > pyproject.toml, oe_eval, specific configuration files, CLI
  > arguments, output file types).

- **Structured Data Representation:** Utilize tables to summarize key
  > information concisely and consistently, such as dependencies, core
  > CLI arguments, and output file descriptions. This provides easily
  > parsable data points.

- **Causal Explanations:** Explicitly articulate the connections between
  > design choices and their motivations or consequences. For example:
  > \"To address the need for evaluating models with varying
  > instruction-following capabilities, OLMES implements distinct MCF
  > and CF configurations, allowing for fairer comparison.\" or \"The
  > use of Python for configuration was chosen to enable complex,
  > programmatic definitions required for intricate research
  > experiments, although this increases the learning curve compared to
  > declarative formats.\"

- **Code Linkage:** Whenever possible, link conceptual descriptions to
  > specific artifacts in the repository (e.g., \"Model definitions
  > reside in oe_eval/configs/models.py within the MODEL_CONFIGS
  > dictionary.\" or \"The evaluation process is initiated via the olmes
  > command, which maps to the oe_eval.launch:main entry point defined
  > in pyproject.toml.\").

By adhering to these principles, the complex information about the OLMES
framework can be structured in a way that facilitates understanding and
potential automated reasoning by AI systems.

In conclusion, OLMES represents a sophisticated, well-documented, and
open evaluation system tailored for rigorous LLM research and
development. Its strengths lie in its commitment to reproducibility, its
flexible Python-based configuration engine, detailed logging
capabilities, and integration into the broader research ecosystem. While
its complexity might present a learning curve, the architectural
patterns and specific features offer valuable lessons and potentially
reusable components for any team involved in serious LLM evaluation.
Understanding its design choices, particularly in comparison to simpler
frameworks, provides critical context for deciding whether and how to
adopt or adapt its principles.
